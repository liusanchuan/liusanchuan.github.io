### [Software Setup](#software-setup)
OpenMANIPULATOR-X surpports bath of ROS develop environment and an embedded system (OpenCR). Choose the development environment you want to run OpenMANIPULATOR-X, and configure the software for the environment.

#### ROS Environment
In the ROS development environment, you can run OpenMANIPULATOR-X using various packages provided by ROS as well as our ROS package. In this case, all the processes to run OpenMANIPULATOR-X are done in PC, and electric board is used only to convert the digital signal coming from PC into the communication signal used in dynamixel. If you want to run OpenMANIPULATOR-X in ROS environment, please install Linux, ROS and ROS package on PC according to [[ROS] Setup](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_setup/#ros-setup) chapter.

<!-- <img src="/assets/images/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_enabled.png" width="150" border="0"> -->

#### Embedded System
If you use OpenMANIPULATOR-X in an embedded system (OpenCR), you can easily apply your algorithm  to run OpenMANIPULATOR-X with an easy-to-use system such as the Arduino IDE. In this case, the main process for running the OpenMANIPULATOR-X is done inside the embedded system, and commands can be sent to the embedded system using the GUI program of the PC, the joystick controller, or a simple sensor. If you want to run the OpenMANIPULATOR-X on an embedded system, install the software on your PC and set up OpenCR by following the [[OpenCR] Setup](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/opencr_setup/#opencr-setup) chapter.

## [Let's try Basic Operation](#lets-try-basic-operation)

### [Basic Operation on ROS Environment](#basic-operation-on-ros-environment)
Once you have completed the above steps, run OpenMANIPULATOR-X through the provided Controller package. You can command the OpenMANIPULATOR-X to move specific position via ROS messages. Refer to the following page to run the controller package and test whether it works well. 

- [Controller Package](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_controller_package)

After you have successfully run the controller package, you can run OpenMANIPULATOR-X by publishing ROS messages to the controller package using the packages we provide. The following basic operation example is provided as a package for ROS message publishing.

- [GUI Program](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_operation/#gui-program)
- [Teleoperation](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_operation/#teleoperation)

OpenMANIPULATOR-X can also be operated using MoveIt!. You can run the controller package that uses MoveIt! by changing the variables in the launch file of the controller package. Please refer to the following chapters and try out various motions with MoveIt!.

- [MoveIt!](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_operation/#moveit)

<img src="/assets/images/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_basic_operation.png" width="800">

### [Basic Operation on Embedded System](##basic-operation-on-embedded-system)
OpenMANIPULATOR-X can be operated not only with ROS but also with simple embedded system (OpenCR). In the embedded system (OpenCR), the control process for operating the OpenMANIPULATOR-X operates inside OpenCR. Refer to the following page to upload the controller to OpenCR.

- [Upload Controller](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/opencr_operation/#upload-controller)

There are various methods to send commands to the controller running within OpenCR. We provide the Processing source code as an example of sending commands over the USB port and receiving the status of the manipulator. We also configured the controller to operate the manipulator using the RC100 controller. Try to control the OpenMANIPULATOR-X using OpenCR referring to the following page.

- [GUI Program (Processing)](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/opencr_operation/#gui-program)
- [Teleoperation RC100](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/opencr_operation/#teleoperation-rc100)

## [Challenge Applications](#challenge-applications)
Do you want to apply the OpenMANIPULATOR-X to real work? Try applying the new ROS package to the OpenMANIPULATOR-X. Can be applied to various tasks. We provide examples of AR marker recognition using Astra pro, Realsence D435, and Raspberry Pi Camera V2. Refer the example below to challenge the camera-based manipulation applications.

- [Camera Application](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_applications/#camera-application)

Do you want to run the OpenMANIPULATOR-X in a space that is not accessible to humans? And you want simple, intuitive motionplanning? The master-slave application is the answer. We have provided an example that makes it easy to create motion by linking the two OpenMANIPULATOR-Xs and operating the master manipulator with hand guide teaching. Try the master-slave application by following the link below.

- [Master Slave](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_applications/#master-slave)
