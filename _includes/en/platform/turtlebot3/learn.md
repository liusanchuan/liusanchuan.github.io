## [The Construct](#the-construct)

This **MASTERING WITH ROS: TurtleBot3** lecture is made by [the Construct](http://www.theconstructsim.com/). Within this Course, you are going to learn how you can start working with the TurtleBot3 robot, explore its functionalitities, and how to build interesting ROS applications. If you want to learn more about ROS, please check the [ROBOT IGNITE ACADEMY](http://www.theconstructsim.com/construct-learn-develop-robots-using-ros/robotigniteacademy_learnros/) that contains series of online ROS tutorials tied to online simulations, giving you the tools and knowledge to understand and create any ROS based robotics development.

## [Youtube Course](#youtube-course)

This ROS courses are a ROS robot programming guide based on the experiences we had accumulated from ROS projects like TurtleBot3, OpenCR and OpenManipulator. We tried to make this a comprehensive guide that covers all aspects necessary for a beginner in ROS. Topics such as embedded system, mobile robots, and robot arms programmed with ROS are included. For those who are new to ROS, there are footnotes throughout the courses providing more information on the web. Through this ROS courses and book, we hope that more people will be aware of and participate in bringing forward the ever-accelerating collective knowledge of Robotics Engineering.

### This Handbook is written for

College students and graduate students who want to learn robot programming based on ROS (Robot Operating system) and also for professional researchers and engineers who work on robot development or software programming. We have tried to offer detailed information we learned while working on TurtleBot3 and OpenManipulator. We hope this book will be the complete handbook for beginners in ROS and more people will contribute to the ever-growing community of open robotics.

### What you will learn from this book

From the basic concept to practical robot application programming!

- ROS Kinetic Kame : Basic concept, instructions and tools
- How to use sensor and actuator packages on ROS
- Embedded board for ROS : OpenCR1.0
- SLAM & Navigation with TurtleBot3
- How to program a delivery robot using ROS Java
- OpenManipulator simulation using MoveIt! and Gazebo
