**WARRNING** : Please turn off the power switch before connecting power source(battery or SMPS) to the product.
{: .notice--warning}


### [Control Table](#contrl-table)
Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of OpenCR. The user can control OpenCR by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

#### EEPROM and RAM
Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

#### Address
Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

#### Access
OpenCR has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

#### Initial Value
In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

#### Highest/Lowest Byte
In the Control table, some data share the same name, but they are attached with (L) or (H) at the end of each name to distinguish the address. This data requires 16-bit, but it is divided into 8bit each for the addresses (low) and (high). These two addresses should be written with one Instruction Packet simutaneously.

### [EEPROM Area](#eeprom-area)

### [Address Function Help](#address-function-help)

#### Model Number
Represents the Model Number.

#### Firmware Version
Represents the firmware version.

#### ID
Is a unique number to identify Dynamixel.  
Values range from 0 (0x00) to 252 (0xFC), Value 254 (0xFE) is used as the Broadcast ID.  
If the Broadcast ID is used to transmit Instruction Packet, then it can command to all Dynamixels.  

**NOTE** : Do NOT assign an identical ID for DYNAMIXELs in the same network.
{: .notice}

#### Baud Rate
Represents the communication speed. 0 (0x00) to 7 (0x07) can be used for it.

| Data |  Set BPS  | Target BPS | Tolerance |

**NOTE** : Maximum Baud Rate error of 3% is within the tolerance of UART communication.
{: .notice}

#### Return Delay Time

Return Delay Time will set a timer to hold a Status Packet transmission for a received Instruction Packet.  
This data has a multiplier of 2μsec, therefore set value will be multiplied by 2 microseconds.  
For example, if Return Delay Time is set to 10, a Status Packet will be transmitted after 20 microseconds after receiving an Instruction Packet.  
Available data values range from 0 (0x00) to 254 (0xFE).

#### Status Return Level
Status Return Level decides whether to return a Status Packet or not for an Instruction Packet.  
There are three options as below table.  
If an Instruction Packet has a Broadcast ID, Status Packet will not be returned regardless of Status Return Level.

| Value |               Return of Status Packet                |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
|   0   | No return against all commands (Except PING Command) |
|   1   |           Return only for the READ command           |
|   2   |               Return for all commands                |

**NOTE** : When Instruction packet is Broadcast ID, Status packet is not returned regardless of Status return level.
