# [Introduction](#introduction)

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_001.gif)

In computer science, a task generally means a set of relevant activities to complete the work at hand. In RoboPlus terms, a task code is a source code programmed for a robot to complete a task.  
A robot operates according to the task code created by the user, and the RoboPlus Task is a program that helps the user to write task code easily. Task code files have a .tskx extension in the PC (or smartphone).  
(Previous versions use a .tsk extension, which can be converted to .tskx via R+ Task 2.0)

- What does the Task file have to do with the Motion file?  
  The Task file is the program code that defines the logic and thought process of how the robot will think and act, and the Motion file is the data which defines the behavior to be taken according to the decision made on the Task file.  
  If the robot that I make will only be using simple movements, then you do not need to use a Motion file when writing a Task file.  
  But if I need the robot to perform accurate movements or a great number of movements such as dancing, then using a Motion file will be more efficient.  
  (If user wants to use a Motion file in the task code, the user must download the Motion file.)

## [Resources for Task](#resources-for-task)

Resources in Task Code vary depending on the device connected with the controller.

1. If controller is connected to an external hardware such as a Dynamic Cell, then the Task Code can use it.
2. If controller is connected to a smart app(R+ Smart or R+ IoT), then the Task Code can use it.
3. If user has downloaded motion data into the Controller via R+ Motion, then the Task Code can use it.

Resources available in Task Code are comprised as below

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_010.jpg)

## [Task Code Structure](#task-code-structure)

Task code is comprised of 3 elements (code lines, instructions, and parameters).

1. Parameter  
  This is the smallest unit that represents variables or hardware characteristics. User can read or write the value.

2. Instructions  
  Indicates a single behavior(computation) given to the Controller to execute the program. Each instruction promises a unique behavior, and the number of parameters vary depending on the behavior(computation).

3. Code line (Command line)  
  The smallest unit that executes the program, which is a combination of instruction and parameter. Generally, the program is executed in order of the code lines.

# [Programming(Instructions)](#programminginstructions)

This section explains the instructions used in R+ Task 2.0

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_046.jpg)

## [Start/End](#startend)

This instruction establishes the overall beginning and end of a program, and the valid block for the instruction.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_047.jpg)
 
### Start Program

- The Start Program instruction is executed regardless of the line number.
- There cannot be more than one Start Program instruction in one program.
- There must be an instruction enclosing block mandatorily.
- When program reaches the end of the Start Program instruction, the program will be end.
- It is the same concept as the main() function in C programming language.

- The following figure shows a Start Program instruction that is empty inside.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_048.jpg)


### End Program

- The user can manually set the location where the program will end.
- If End Program is not set manually, then the program will execute every code in the Start Program instruction and then end naturally.

- The following displays a "natural end" of a program after executing every code in the Start Program instruction.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_049.jpg)

- The following displays a forced end of a program when meeting an End Program instruction.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_050.jpg)

### Begin Block / End Block

- A block is an enclosed set of multiple lines of instructions.
- The beginning and end of a block must always go in pairs.
- If the instruction code is only one line then you can omit the block symbols.
- It is the same concept as brackets ‘{‘, ‘}’ in C programming language

- The following figure indicates the block for “Start Program” and “Endless Loop”

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_051.jpg)

- The following figure indicates the block for “Start Program” and “If”

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_052.jpg)

- As the following figure indicates, if the instruction code is only one line then you can omit the block symbols.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_053.jpg)

### Comment

- If an explanation needs to be added, you can add a comment(memo) in the line.
- By inserting the `//` symbol, you can double-click it to modify the content that follows.
- While you are modifying a comment, you can click the ESC key to restore to the previous state of the comment.

- The following is an example of inserting a comment to make the source code easier to understand.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_054.jpg)

## [Execute](#execute)

This is an instruction for giving a command to the device or performing a mathematical calculation.
Refer to the following figure for details.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_055.jpg)

### Compute

- This instruction computes two values to give one result. (C = A + B)

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_056.gif)

- You can choose from Add(+), Subtract(-), Multiply(x), And(&), Or(|).

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_057.gif)

- The following is an example of using the Compute instruction.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_058.gif)

### Load

- This instruction substitutes a value with another one.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_059.gif)

- This instruction is used when reading/writing a variable’s value.
- The following is an example of writing a value to the variable “speed”, and then reading this variable’s value to apply it to the Geared Motor.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_060.jpg)

- This instruction is used when reading/writing a device’s value.
- The following is an example of setting the speed value of a Geared Motor connected to Port number 1.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_061.jpg)

### Lable/Jump

- These instructions are used for branching of the program.
- Label determines the location of the branching.
- Using Jump you can execute a predesignated label first.
- It is the same concept as ‘label / goto’ commands in C programming language

- The figures below show how the program branches by using Jump
- The figure on the left shows the program jumping to Mode1 and executing only the code from Mode1.
- The figure on the right shows the program jumping to Mode2 and executing only the code from Mode2.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_062.jpg)

- Label and Jump must exist inside the same function block.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_063.jpg)

## [Condition](#condition)

This instruction controls the flow of program based on the True/False result of Conditional Clause.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_064.jpg)

### Conditional Clause?

- A conditional clause gives the result of a computation as either true or false.

- Below are the comparison operators that can be used inside the parenthesis().
  - == : check if left and right values are the same
  - != : check if left and right values are not the same
  - &gt; : check if left value is greater than the right value
  - &gt;= : check if left value is greater or equal to the right value
  - &lt; : check if right value is greater than the left value
  - &lt;= : check if right value is greater or equal to the left value

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_065.jpg)

- When many conditions must be satisfied, multiple conditional clauses can be used together as below:

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_066.jpg)

- When using multiple conditional clauses, the following logical operators can be used :
  - then : does not connect any conditional clause. Only uses one conditional clause.
  - && : two conditional clauses are computed with AND operation
  - \|\| : two conditional clauses are computed with OR operation

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_067.jpg)

### If

- If the result of the conditional clause is true, then it executes the code inside the block.
- It is the same concept as the ‘If’ statement in C programming language.

- The following in an example of using If to check whether a variable’s value is 100.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_068.jpg)

- If the code to be executed is only one line, then you can omit the block symbols as below.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_069.jpg)

### Else If

- This is used to check another conditional clause following an If statement.
- An If statement must be used prior to Else If statement
- It is the same concept as the ‘Else If’ statement in C programming language.

- The following in an example of using If to check whether a variable’s value is 100, and the using Else If to check whether the variable’s value is 50.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_070.jpg)

- If the code to be executed is only one line, then you can omit the block symbols as below.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_071.jpg)

### Else

- This statement will execute its code block if none of the If or Else If statements were executed.
- An If statement must be used prior to Else statement
- It is the same concept as the ‘Else’ statement in C programming language.

- The following in an example of using If to check whether a variable’s value is 100, and if the result is false then running the Else statement that follows.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_072.jpg)

- If the code to be executed is only one line, then you can omit the block symbols as below.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_073.jpg)

## [Loop](#loop)

This is an instruction that is used when the program needs to repeat a specific behavior or computation multiple times.  
By setting the repetition block and repetition condition, loop can be applied in a variety of ways. Refer to the following figure for details.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_074.jpg)

### Endless Loop

- This statement will repeatedly execute from the beginning to the end of the code block endlessly
- You can come out of the loop by using the “End Loop” command.
- It is the same concept as ‘while(1)’  in C programming language.

- The following is an example of using Endless Loop to print the number 100 on the screen. The printing command is within the Endless Loop block so it is repeatedly executed with no end.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_075.jpg)

- If the code to be executed is only one line, then you can omit the block symbols as below.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_076.jpg)

### Loop While

- This statement will repeatedly execute from the beginning to the end of the code block as long as the conditional clause is satisfied.
- Just as in Condition instructions, multiple conditional clauses can be used together.
- You can come out of the loop by using the “End Loop” command.
- It is the same concept as ‘while(conditional clause)’ in C programming language.

- The following is an example of using Loop While to print the number 100 on the screen for only 1.024 seconds.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_077.jpg)

- The following is an example of using Loop While and a variable to print the number 100 on the screen just 10 times.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_078.jpg)

### Loop For

- This statement will execute from the beginning to the end of the code block a specified number of times.
- Every time the program reaches the end of the block, the value of a specified variable will increase by 1.
- You can come out of the loop by using the “End Loop” command.
- Repeat count formula : Repeat count = End value – Starting Value + 1
- It is the same concept as ‘for’ in C programming language.

- The following is an example of using Loop For to print the number 100 on the screen 10 times.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_079.jpg)

- The following is an example of taking the variable from Loop For and using it within the execution block. As the repeat count increases from 1 to 10, the value printed on the screen changes to 100, 200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_080.jpg)

### Wait While

- This statement will stop execution of the program as long as the conditional clause is satisfied.
- It is the same concept as ‘while(conditional clause)’ with an empty code block in C programming language.

- The following is an example of using Wait While and a timer to make the program wait for 1.024 seconds.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_081.jpg)

- The following is an example of using Wait While to make the program wait until the motion being performed finishes.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_082.jpg)

- The following is an example of using Wait While to make the program wait until the melody being played finishes.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_083.jpg)

### Break Loop

- This command is used when you wish to break from a loop.
- This command can only be used within Endless Loop, Loop While, and Loop For statement.
- It is the same concept as ‘break’ in C programming language.

- The following is an example of using Break Loop when a wireless data arrives in order to break from the loop. When the program breaks from the loop, whichever code that follows is executed.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_084.jpg)

## [Function(Sub-Routine)](#functionsub-routine)

If a specific code is used repeatedly, or if you wish to classify an area of code as a unit that performs a specific behavior, you can group the lines of code as a Function.
Refer to the following figure for details.

### Function/Call

- If a specific code is used repeatedly, or if you wish to classify an area of code as a unit that performs a specific behavior, you can group the lines of code as a Function.
- An adequate use of functions will make the code concise and easy to read.
- A function that has been created can be used with “Call” instruction when needed.
- Functions must be written outside of the main program routine.
- In task, functions cannot configure input or output arguments
- It is the same concept as a ‘function’ in C programming language.

- The following is an example of making the action of blinking the LED as a function and using it.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_086.jpg)

- The following is the process of selecting a function to call.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_087.jpg)

- Functions cannot call itself within the same function.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_088.jpg)

### Return

- This is an instruction used for exiting a function while it is being executed.
- It can only be used inside a regular function and callback function.
- It is the same concept as ‘return’ in C programming language.

- The following is an example of a function being executed until the end without using Return.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_089.jpg)

- The following is an example of a function being executed but encountering Return in the middle of executing the function, which will make the program exit the function.

  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/task/roboplus_task2_090.jpg)

### Callback

- This is a function that is executed independently from the main program routine, executing itself periodically
- Callback functions must be written outside of the main program routine.
- Because it is not allowed to write code within a callback that takes too much time to execute, callback has restrictions in the use of Loops / Variables / Parameter Calls / volume of code.
- The following restrictions must be met when using a callback function.
  - Loops, Labels, Jumps, Calls are not allowed
  - Communication with an external device is limited to a maximum of 2 times
  - The code size of callback function cannot exceed 512 bytes

- The following is an example of using the callback function to receive wireless data and save it to the variable “received data”.

## [Grammar/Compile Check](#grammarcompile-check)

In order to download the task code to the controller, it must go through a grammar check and compile process. If you try to download to the controller or click the "Error" button, it will run the grammar check and compile process automatically.

- **Grammar Check** : This is the process of examining whether the instructions used in the task code are compatible instructions with the controller, and whether there are any errors in the grammar.  
  All errors must be corrected before it can move on to the next step.
- **Compilation** : This is the process of converting the code that has finished grammar check into a machine language that the controller can interpret.  
  The number of variables, callback usage, and memory usage are examined during the compilation process.
