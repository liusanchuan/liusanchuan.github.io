### [LabVIEW Indirect Address Protocol 2.0](#labview-indirect-address-protocol-20)

- Description

  This example writes the goal position and LED value and repeats to read present position and moving status through the indirect data storage, rather than write directly to the their own data storages. The indirect address links between direct and indirect data storages. This makes the Syncread and the Syncwrite function accessible to the items which are far from each otherâ€™s address.

- Available Dynamixel

  All series using protocol 2.0
