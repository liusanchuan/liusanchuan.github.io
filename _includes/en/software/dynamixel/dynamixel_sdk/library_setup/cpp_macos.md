## [CPP macOS](#cpp-macos)

### [Compiler and Builder](#compiler-and-builder)

#### [Compiler](#compiler)

* GNU gcc ver. 5.4.0 20160609 or higher
* To check the version of your gcc compiler:  

  ``` bash
  $ gcc -v 
  ```

* Download the required compiler:  

  ``` bash 
  $ sudo apt-get install gcc-5
  ```

#### [Builder](#builder)

* Build-essential pkg â†’ make
* Download:  

  ``` bash 
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

#### [Dependent Packages](#dependent-packages) 

* Packages needed for cross-compiling 
* Download:  

  ``` bash 
  $ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
  ```

#### [Build the Library](#build-the-library)

* PC which is being sold recently only comes as 64bit platform. The Makefile is located in the following folder: `[DynamixelSDK folder]/cpp/build/mac` folder for 64-bit platforms.  

Please note that if you will be building the 64-bit example source, you should build the 64-bit library.

-->

* Go to the Makefile's directory located in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/cpp/build/mac` using $ `cd`.

* To build the library file:  

  ``` bash
  $ make
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/library_file/cpp1.png)
-->

* If there is an error:  

  ``` bash
  $ make clean && make
  ```

* To delete the library file and object files:  

  ``` bash
  $ make clean
  ```
<!--

-->

##### Copy (Install) the Library to the Root Directory

* To make library file and copy it to the root directory (to handle the serial port):  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make install
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/library_file/cpp3.png)
-->

* If there is an error:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make uninstall && sudo make install
  ```
   
  OR

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make reinstall
  ```

* To delete the library file from the root directory:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make uninstall
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/library_file/cpp4.png)
-->

* To recopy the library file to the root directory:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make reinstall
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/library_file/cpp5.png)
-->

* You will see the built library file in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/cpp/build/mac/libdxl_mac_cpp.dylib`


### [Building and Running the Sample Code](#building-and-running-the-sample-code)

The Dynamixel SDK sample code for CPP uses the library files(.dylib for Mac) built in CPP language.

You should build library files in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c++/build/mac/libdxl_mac_cpp.dylib` with its own source code as shown above. 

* The Makefile file for building source is in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c++/example/protocol1.0/read_write/mac` folder. 
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/sample_code/excp4.png)
-->

* On the terminal, go to the Makefile located folder `/c++/example/protocol1.0/read_write/mac`, for example, using `cd`.

* To build executable file, type: 

  ```bash
  $ make
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/sample_code/excp1.png)
-->
If it shows some error, try `make clean` and `make` it again.

* To delete executable file, type: 

  ```bash
  $ make clean
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/sample_code/excp2.png)
-->
* Make the port available to be used

  ```bash
  $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/tty.usbserial-xxxx
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/cpp/mac/sample_code/excp3.png)
-->
* Run the source code

  ```bash
  $ ./read_write
  ```
