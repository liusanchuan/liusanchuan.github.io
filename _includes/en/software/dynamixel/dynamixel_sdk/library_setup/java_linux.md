### [Building and Running the Sample Code](#building-and-running-the-sample-code)

The Dynamixel SDK example code for Java uses the library files(.so for Linux) built in C language.

Each released Dynamixel SDK have latest library files in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c/build/[linuxXX]/libdxl_xYY_c.so` which should be built by its own source code.
