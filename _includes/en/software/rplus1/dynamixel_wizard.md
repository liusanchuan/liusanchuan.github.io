# [Introduction](#introduction)

Dynamixel Wizard helps the users manage Dynamixel more easily.  
The main roles of the program are as follows:
- Manage Dynamixel's firmware.
- Check Dynamixel's status.
- Set up the necessary modes.

# [Connecting Dynamixel](#connecting-dynamixel)

1. Connect Dynamixel to PC through [USB2Dynamixel].
  - Please refer to [USB2Dynamixel] for how to connect.
  - The appropriate power cable for Dynamixel must be connected separately.
 
2. Select the communication port.  

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_002.png)

    If the relevant port is appeared as "In Use," then Dynamixel Wizard cannot be used.
 
3. Search Dynamixel. The search range can be set, if necessary.

# [Firmware Update](#firmware-update)

Firmware is a program installed in Dynamixel, and it controls Dynamixel.  
Dynamixel Wizard automatically detects a new firmware through internet and always keeps it updated.

# [Firmware Recovery](#firmware-recovery)

If any problems occur in Dynamixel firmware, Dynamixel Wizard can restore the firmware.
 
{% capture wizard_warning_01 %}
**CAUTION** : Every data value will be initialized after the firmware restoration. Please check once again the ID and Baud rate before executing the program if you restored the firmware.  
Please check the mode on the USB2Dynamixel. 3 pin cables should be set to TTL and 4 pin cables should be set to the RS485 switch.
{% endcapture %}

## How to Restore Dynamixel Firmware

1. Execute Dynamixel Firmware Restoration Wizard.  
    Execute Dynamixel Firmware Wizard by clicking firmware restoration button on the tools.  
    When COM port is connected, the corresponding button will be inactivated. Then, please disconnect the port, and start the firmware restoration wizard.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_012.png)
 
2. Dynamixel Firmware Restoration Wizard is started with simple messages.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_013.png)
 
3. Connect only 1 Dynamixel when Dynamixel firmware is being restored.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_014.png)
 
4. Select Dynamixel Connection Port  
    Dynamixel cannot be searched automatically because the firmware is not recognized. Therefore, the users must set the Dynamixel connected port manually.  Since Dynamixel cannot be recognized if the port is in use, finish other programs, and then continue the procedure.  
    Select USB2Dynamixel-connected port and press "Search" button.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_015.png)
 
5. Turn off the power of Dynamixel and then turn it back on.  
    Turn off the power of Dynamixel for restoration and then turn it on again to detect Dynamixel.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_016.png)
 
6. If Dynamixel search is succeeded, you can see the window as below.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_017.png)
 
7. Select Dynamixel Firmware  
    If Dynamixel is found, the information of downloadable firmware is appeared.  The users must select the correct model because the model name cannot be recognized automatically in Dynamixel firmware restoration mode. If an incorrect model is chosen, it is not operated normally.
 
    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/wizard/dynamixel_wizard_018.png)
 
8. Restore Firmware  
    Click "Next" button to start firmware restoration.  Please be careful not to disconnect or turn off the power until it is completed.
