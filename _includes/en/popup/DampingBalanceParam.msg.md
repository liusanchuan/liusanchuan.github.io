- Description
These are the parameters used in the Balance Algorithm.
Most algorithms are based on PD Control, therefore, gain and timeconstant are declared in pairs.

**COB Offset**
* ` float32 cob_x_offset_m`
&emsp;&emsp; x_offset of cob
* ` float32 cob_y_offset_m`
&emsp;&emsp; y_offset of cob


**FeedForward**
* ` float32 hip_roll_swap_angle_rad`
&emsp;&emsp; Feedforward of Hip Roll



**Gain**
* ` float32 gyro_gain`
&emsp;&emsp; Gain for the Gyro
* ` float32 foot_roll_angle_gain`
&emsp;&emsp; Gain for the Roll data acquired from the IMU
