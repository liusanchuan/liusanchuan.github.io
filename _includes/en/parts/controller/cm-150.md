# [Introduction](#introduction)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-150/cm-150_product.jpg)

> CM-150

- Control DREAM robots, connect various components (reduction motors, servo motors, LED mobules, IR sensor, etc).
- Recover controller firmware with [RoboPlus Manager] (v1.0.30.0 or higher) or [RoboPlus Manager 2.0]
- Write a task code and control robot’s components with [RoboPlus Task](v1.1.0.0 or higher) or [RoboPlus Task 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus2/task/)
- RoboPlus Motion does NOT support the CM-150

# [Control Table](#control-table)
Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of controller. The user can control controller by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

- EEPROM and RAM  
  Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

- Address  
  Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

- Access  
  Controller has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

- Initial Value  
  In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
  In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

- Size  
  The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.
