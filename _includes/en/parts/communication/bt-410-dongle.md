# [Communication Mode](#communication-mode)

Utilizes a pairing mechanism that allows reliable 1:1 communication.

## [1:1 Communication](11-communication)

- Once the power is supplied to the Bluetooth module, the blue LED will blink. Successful pairing will turn on the solid blue LED.
- **Auto Pairing** : When the blue LED of BT-410 dongle is blinking(not paired), approach the BT-410 Slave module near the BT-410 dongle(within 10cm) to automatically pair both devices. Successfully paired devices can be paired again within the range of Bluetooth communication.

# [BT-410 Dongle Setting](bt-410-dongle-setting)
Can reset system, change device name, and set SLAVE address, but **CANNOT** change mode.

## [Setup](#setup)

1. Connect the BT-410 dongle to PC and check assigned port number from the Device Manager. Then connect using the Tera Term terminal program through the respective COM port.

6. Enable Local echo.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_08.png)

7. If an exclamation mark("!") is entered, "OK" will be returned and command mode becomes available. If entering "AT" on the terminal returns "OK", BT-410 dongle is successfully connected and ready to be configured.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_09.png)

8. The command "AT+BTINQ=DBE7DF000001" will search for the BLE devices whose MAC address is higher than DBE7DF000001.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_10.png)

9. After searching for available devices with "AT+BTINQ" command, use returned MAC address to pair with the device. For example, in order to pair with above searched device, use "ATD" command followed by the MAC address: "ATDDBE7DF00512B".

# [AT Commands](#at-commands)

The followings are AT terminal commands for the BT-410 Dongle.

1. System Reset  
  Enter ATZ to reset BT-410 dongle. If settings are modified, the modified setting will be applied on reset.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_11.png)

2. Search Device  
  Enter "AT+BTINQ=DBE7DF000001" to search for the Bluetooth devices whose MAC address is higher than DBE7DF000001.             

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_12.png)

3. Auto Pairing  
  Unpaired BT-410 Slave module can be automatically paired if it is located within 10 cm to the BT-410 dongle.  

4. Disable Auto Pairing  
  Enter "AT+BTAUTOPAIR=0"

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_13.png)

5. Enable Auto Pairing  
  Enter "AT+BTAUTOPAIR=1"

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_15.png)

    A few seconds later, below message will be displayed.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_dongle_16.png)

6. Change Baudrate  
  AT+BTUART,baudrate,parity_bit,stop_bit  
  `Example` AT+BTUART,57600,n,1  

# [Check Driver](#check-driver)
How to check whether the BT-410 Dongle driver is installed correctly is as follows.

1. Connect **BT-410 Dongle** to the **USB Port** of PC.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-410_17.png)

2. Select Manage in the popped-up menu shown by right-clicking My Computer.

    ![img_04][img_04]

3. Check USB Serial Converter in Universal Serial Bus Controllers of Device Manager.

    ![img_05][img_05]

4. Check USB Serial Port(COMx) in the list of Ports(COM & LPT). COM Port number may vary depending on each system.

    ![img_06][img_06]

# [Install Driver Manually](#install-driver-manually)

If you installed RoboPlus, FTDI Driver (USB2Dynamixel, USB Downloader (LN-101) driver, BT-410 Dongle) is installed together automatically. If you didn't install the RoboPlus yet, or if the driver is not installed appropriately, please install it manually according to following procedures.
{: .notice}

1. Connect a device to PC. If the driver is not installed yet, Found New Hardware Wizard will be popped up. Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)(S) -> Next(N)

    ![img_07][img_07]

2. Decide the location of Driver. If RoboPlus S/W has been installed automatically, the driver is in LN101 folder of RoboPlus Installation folder. Or if you want to install the newest version, download the newest version VCP driver from [FTDI Driver Download] page.

    ![img_08][img_08]

    ![img_09][img_09]

3. Click the Next(N) button to start the installation. Installation of USB Serial Converter driver is completed.
