## [Control Table Description](#control-table-description)

### <a name="model-number"></a>**[Model Number (0)](#model-number-0)**
 This address stores model number of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="firmware-version"></a>**[Firmware Version (2)](#firmware-version-2)**
 This address stores firmware version of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="id"></a>**[ID (3)](#id-3)**
 The ID is a unique value in the network to identify each DYNAMIXEL with an Instruction Packet.
 0~252 (0xFC) values can be used as an ID, and 254(0xFE) is occupied as a broadcast ID. The Broadcast ID(254, 0xFE) can send an Instruction Packet to all connected DYNAMIXELs simultaneously.

 **NOTE** : Please avoid using an identical ID for multiple DYNAMIXELs. You may face communication failure or may not be able to detect Dynamixels with an identical ID.
 {: .notice}


### <a name="baud-rate"></a>**[Baud Rate (4)](#baud-rate-4)**
 Baud Rate determines serial communication speed between a controller and DYNAMIXELs.

|    Value    | Baud Rate | Margin of Error |
|:-----------:|:---------:|:---------------:|
|      1      |    1M     |     0.000%      |
|      3      |  500,000  |     0.000%      |
|      4      |  400,000  |     0.000%      |
|      7      |  250,000  |     0.000%      |
|      9      |  200,000  |     0.000%      |
|     16      |  115200   |     -2.124%     |
| 34(Default) |   57600   |     0.794%      |
|     103     |   19200   |     -0.160%     |
|     207     |   9600    |     -0.160%     |

**NOTE** : Less than 3% of the baud rate error margin will not affect to UART communication.
{: .notice}

**NOTE** : For the stable communication with higher baudrate, configure USB Latency value to the lower.  
[USB Latency Setting](/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/#usb-latency-setting) 
{: .notice}


### <a name="return-delay-time"></a>**[Return Delay Time (5)](#return-delay-time-5)**
 After the DYNAMIXEL receives an Instruction Packet, it delays transmitting the Status Packet for Return Delay Time (9). For instance, if the Return Delay Time(9) is set to ‘10’, the Status Packet will be returned after 20[μsec] when the Instruction Packet is received.

 |      | Value     | Description     |
 | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
 |Unit| 2[μsec] | - |
 |Range| 0 ~ 254  | Default value ‘250’(500[μsec]), Maximum 508[μsec]|


### <a name="cw-angle-limit"></a><a name="ccw-angle-limit"></a>**[CW/CCW Angle Limit (6, 8)](#cwccw-angle-limit-6-8)**
The angle limit allows the motion to be restrained.
The range and the unit of the value is the same as Goal Position(Address 30, 31).
CW Angle Limit: the minimum value of Goal Position(Address 30, 31)
CCW Angle Limit: the maximum value of Goal Position(Address 30, 31)
The following two modes can be set pursuant to the value of CW and CCW.

| Operation Type |   CW / CCW    |
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
|   Wheel Mode   |  both are 0   |
|   Joint Mode   | neither are 0 |

The wheel mode can be used to wheel-type operation robots since motors of the robots spin infinitely. The joint mode can be used to multi-joints robot since the robots can be controlled with specific angles.

### <a name="drive-mode"></a>**[Drive Mode (10)](#drive-mode-10)**

|    Bit    |        Item         |             Description             |
|:---------:|:-------------------:|:-----------------------------------:|
| Bit 2 ~ 7 |         N/A         |                  -                  |
|   Bit 1   |  Master/Slave Mode  | 0: Master Mode<br />1 : Slave Mode  |
|   Bit 0   | Normal/Reverse Mode | 0: Normal Mode<br />1: Reverse mode |

- Master Mode
  In case of being used as dual joints, it is set to designate as master.

- Slave Mode
  In case of being used as dual joints, it is set to designate as slave.

- General Mode
  Sets the direction of rotation to set direction.
  Reads normal data values from position.

- Reverse Mode
  Sets the direction of rotation  opposite to set direction.
  Reads inverse data values from position.

  **NOTE** : Reverse mode is to reverse the rotational direction. It can be used conveniently when a symmetrical joint is required.
  {: .notice}

#### Dual Joints
Dual joints are used as 1 joint by controlling 2 motors simultaneously.
To use the dual joints, 1 unit of motor set in master mode and 1 unit of motor set in slave mode are needed.
Next, the motors must be connected to each other using synchronization cable.
- Normal mode synch cable: Drives Master and PWM signals synchronized.
- Reverse mode synch cable: Drives PWM signals in reverse.

![](/assets/images/dxl/ex/ex-106_dual.png)

**NOTE** : Slave is synchronized by directly receiving the control command through synchronization cable from Master.  Slave Mode unit responds to communication through command packets, but data related to motor drive are processed only through the synchronization.
{: .notice}

**NOTE** : In a dual master-slave configuration position information from the slave is ignored and the position of the dual configuration is based on the master in PWM control. When master and slave are not physically connected there could be a slight difference on the driven load. Use the frame shown in the below image to achieve dual configuration.

### <a name="temperature-limit"></a>**[Temperature Limit (11)](#temperature-limit-11)**
**CAUTION** : Do not set the temperature lower/higher than the default value. When the temperature alarm shutdown occurs, wait 20 minutes to cool the temperature before re-use. Using the product when the temperature is high may and can cause damage.
{: .notice--warning}

### <a name="min-voltage-limit"></a><a name="max-voltage-limit"></a>**[Min/Max Voltage Limit (12, 13)](#minmax-voltage-limit-12-13)**
It is the operation range of voltage.

|    Unit    | Value Range | Description |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| About 0.1V |  50 ~ 250   | 5.0 ~ 25.0V |

For example, if the value is 80, the voltage is 8V.
If [Present Voltage(42)] is out of the range, Voltage Range Error Bit (Bit0) of Status Packet is returned as ‘1’ and Alarm is triggered as set in the addresses 17 and 18.

[Present Voltage(42)]: #present-voltage

### <a name="max-torque"></a>**[Max Torque (14)](#max-torque-14)**
It is the torque value of maximum output. 0 to 1023 (0x3FF) can be used, and the unit is about 0.1%.
For example, Data 1023 (0x3FF) means that Dynamixel will use 100% of the maximum torque it can produce while Data 512 (0x200) means that Dynamixel will use 50% of the maximum torque. When the power is turned on, Torque Limit (Addresses 34 and 35) uses the value as the initial value.

### <a name="status-return-level"></a>**[Status Return Level (16)](#status-return-level-16)**
It decides how to return Status Packet. There are three ways like the below table.

| Value | Return of Status Packet                              |
|:-----:|:-----------------------------------------------------|
|   0   | No return against all commands (Except PING Command) |
|   1   | Return only for the READ command                     |
|   2   | Return for all commands                              |

When Instruction Packet is Broadcast ID, Status Packet is not returned regardless of Status Return Level.

### <a name="alarm-led"></a><a name="shutdown"></a>**[Alarm LED(17), Shutdown(18)](#alarm-led17-shutdown18)**
Dynamixel can protect itself by detecting errors occur during the operation.
The errors can be set are as the table below.

|  Bit  |        Name         | Description                                                                                                |

| Bit 6 |  Instruction Error  | When undefined Instruction is transmitted or the Action command is delivered without the reg_write command |
| Bit 5 |   Overload Error    | When the current load cannot be controlled with the set maximum torque                                     |
| Bit 4 |   CheckSum Error    | When the Checksum of the transmitted Instruction Packet is invalid                                         |
| Bit 3 |     Range Error     | When the command is given beyond the range of usage                                                        |
| Bit 2 |  OverHeating Error  | When the internal temperature is out of the range of operating temperature set in the Control Table        |
| Bit 1 |  Angle Limit Error  | When Goal Position is written with the value that is not between CW Angle Limit and CCW Angle Limit        |
| Bit 0 | Input Voltage Error | When the applied voltage is out of the range of operating voltage set in the Control Table                 |

It is possible to make duplicate set since the function of each bit is run by  the logic of ‘OR’. That is, if 0X05 (binary 00000101) is set, both Input Voltage Error and Overheating Error can be detected.
If errors occur, in case of Alarm LED, the LED blinks; in case of Alarm Shutdown, the motor output becomes 0 % by making the value of Torque Limit(Address 34, 35) as 0.

### <a name="cw-compliance-margin"></a><a name="ccw-compliance-margin"></a>**[Compliance Margin (26, 27)](#compliance-margin-26-27)**
It exists in each direction of CW/CCW and means the error between goal position and present position.
The range of the value is 0~255, and the unit is the same as Goal Position.(Address 30,31)
The greater the value, the more difference occurs.

### <a name="cw-compliance-slope"></a><a name="ccw-compliance-slope"></a>**[Compliance Slope (28, 29)](#compliance-slope-28-29)**
It exists in each direction of CW/CCW and sets the level of Torque near the goal position.
Compliance Slope is set in 7 steps, the higher the value, the more flexibility is obtained.
Data representative value is actually used value.  That is, even if the value is set to 25, 16 is used internally as the representative value.

| Step |     Data Value      | Data Representative Value |
|:----:|:-------------------:|:-------------------------:|
|  1   |  0(0x00) ~ 3(0x03)  |          2(0x02)          |

### <a name="goal-position"></a>**[Goal Position (30)](#goal-position-30)**
It is a position value of destination.
0 to 1023 (0x3FF) is available.  The unit is 0.29 degree.
If Goal Position is out of the range, Angle Limit Error Bit (Bit1) of Status Packet is returned as ‘1’ and Alarm is triggered as set in Alarm LED/Shutdown.

The picture above is the front view of Dynamixel

**NOTE** : If it is set to Wheel Mode, this value is not used.
{: .notice}

### <a name="moving-speed"></a>**[Moving Speed (32)](#moving-speed-32)**
It is a moving speed to Goal Position.
The range and the unit of the value may vary depending on the operation mode.

+ Join Mode
  0~1023 (0X3FF) can be used, and the unit is about 0.111rpm.
  If it is set to 0, it means the maximum rpm of the motor is used without controlling the speed.
  If it is 1023, it is about 114rpm.
  For example, if it is set to 300, it is about 33.3 rpm.

+ Wheel Mode
  0~2047( 0X7FF) can be used, the unit is about 0.1%.
  If a value in the range of 0~1023 is used, it is stopped by setting to 0 while rotating to CCW direction.
  If a value in the range of 1024~2047 is used, it is stopped by setting to 1024 while rotating to CW direction.
  That is, the 10th bit becomes the direction bit to control the direction.
  In Wheel Mode, only the output control is possible, not speed.
  For example, if it is set to 512, it means the output is controlled by 50% of the maximum output.

**NOTE** : Please check the maximum rpm of the Dynamixel. The motor cannot exceed the maximum rpm with the higher Moving Speed value.
{: .notice}

### <a name="torque-limit"></a>**[Torque Limit (34)](#torque-limit-34)**
It is the value of the maximum torque limit.
0 to 1023 (0x3FF) is available, and the unit is about 0.1%.
For example, if the value is 512, it is about 50%; that means only 50% of the maximum torque will be used.
If the power is turned on, the value of Max Torque (Address 14, 15) is used as the initial value.

**NOTE** : If the function of Alarm Shutdown is triggered, the motor loses its torque because the value becomes 0. At this moment, if the value is changed to the value other than 0, the motor can be used again.
{: .notice}

### <a name="present-position"></a>**[Present Position (36)](#present-position-36)**
It is the current position value of Dynamixel.
The range of the value is 0~1023 (0x3FF), and the unit is 0.29 degree.

![](/assets/images/dxl/ex/ex-106_goal_position.png)
The picture above is the front view of Dynamixel.

+ Wheel Mode
  The range of the value is 0~65535(0XFFFF), and the unit is 0.06 degree. In case of Wheel Mode, only the moving distance can be measured since the present location outputs the value of Encoder. It is increased or decreased by 1 depending on the moving direction of wheel. If it is decreased when the value is 0, it becomes 65535; if it is increased when it is 65535, the value becomes 0.

  **Total Moved Angle = (The value currently measured - The value measured in the past) x 0.06**
  According to the formula above, if the total moved angle is greater than 0, it is turned to the direction of CCW; if it is less than 0, it is turned to the direction of CW.
  For example, The value is changed from 5000 to 10000, (10000 - 5000) x 0.06 = 300, and the total moved angle becomes 300 degrees.

### <a name="present-speed"></a>**[Present Speed (38)](#present-speed-38)**
It is the current moving speed.
0~2047 (0X7FF) can be used.
If a value is in the rage of 0~1023, it means that the motor rotates to the CCW direction.
If a value is in the rage of 1024~2047, it means that the motor rotates to the CW direction.
That is, the 10th bit becomes the direction bit to control the direction, and 0 and 1024 are equal.
The unit of this value varies depending on operation mode.

+ Joint Mode
  The unit is about 0.111rpm.
  For example, if it is set to 300, it means that the motor is moving to the CCW direction at a rate of about 33.3rpm.

+ Wheel Mode
  The unit is about 0.1%.
  For example, if it is set to 512, it means that the torque is controlled by 50% of the maximum torque to the CCW direction.

### <a name="present-load"></a>**[Present Load (40)](#present-load-40)**
It means currently applied load.
The range of the value is 0~2047, and the unit is about 0.1%.
If the value is 0~1023, it means the load works to the CCW direction.
If the value is 1024~2047, it means the load works to the CW direction.
That is, the 10th bit becomes the direction bit to control the direction, and 1024 is equal to 0.
For example, the value is 512, it means the load is detected in the direction of CCW about 50% of the maximum torque.

|  Bit  | 15 ~ 11 |       10       |       9 ~ 0       |
|:-----:|:-------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
| Value |    0    | Load Direction | Data (Load Ratio) |

**NOTE** : CCW Load : Load Direction = 0, CW Load : Load Direction = 1
{: .notice}

**NOTE** : Present load is an inferred value based on the internal output value; not a measured value using torque sensor, etc. Therefore, it may be inaccurate for measuring weight or torque. It is recommended to use it for predicting the direction and size of the force being applied to the joint.

### <a name="present-voltage"></a>**[Present Voltage (42)](#present-voltage-42)**
It is the size of the current voltage supplied.
This value is 10 times larger than the actual voltage. For example, when 10V is supplied, the data value is 100 (0x64)

### <a name="present-temperature"></a>**[Present Temperature (43)](#present-temperature-43)**
It is the internal temperature of Dynamixel in Celsius.
Data value is identical to the actual temperature in Celsius. For example, if the data value is 85 (0x55), the current internal temperature is 85&deg;C.

### <a name="registered-instruction"></a>**[Registered Instruction (44)](#registered-instruction-44)**

| Value | Description                                    |

### <a name="punch"></a>**[Punch (48)](#punch-48)**
Current to drive motor is at minimum.
Can choose vales from 0x20 to 0x3FF.

### <a name="sensed-current"></a>**[Sensed Current (56)](#sensed-current-56)**
It is the amount of current in use. The range from 0 to 1023 is used, and the unit is 10mA. The value less than 512 means the motor consumes the current and torques to the direction of CCW. The value greater than 512 means the motor consumes the current and torques to the direction of CW. 512 is equal to 0mA, and it means there is no torque from the motor.

For example, if the value is 612, the motor torques to the direction of CW and consumes 1000mA(612-512=100 => 100x10mA = 1,000mA).

If the value is 312, the motor torques to the direction of CW and consumes 2000mA(512-312= -200 => 200x10mA=2,000mA).
