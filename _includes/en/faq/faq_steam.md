  Please refer to [the controller fuse replacement manual.](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#replacing-fuse)

## **I want to control the robot by myself using C Language.**
  You can use [embedded C(CM530)]{: .blank} to program your own code

## **I want to control the robot remotely using my PC.**
  You can use [Zigbee SDK](/docs/en/software/embedded_sdk/zigbee_sdk/)

## **Which softwares do I need for programming?**
  You can use **RoboPlus Task(R+ 1.0)** or **R+Task 2.0**([Windows](http://en.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=1) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robotis.task2&hl=en) + [BT-210]{: .blank} or [BT-410]{: .blank}) and **RoboPlus Motion(R+ 1.0)** or **R+Motion 2.0**([Windows](http://en.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=3) / [OS X](http://www.robotis.com/sub/page_routing.php?key=1) / [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.robotis.motion&hl=en) + [BT-210]{: .blank} or [BT-410]{: .blank} / [iOS]{: .blank} + [BT-410]{: .blank}). It is recommended to use **R+Task 2.0** and **R+Motion 2.0** because you can directly download the examples within the software instead of visiting e-Manaul for examples.

## **I want to learn how to program the robot.**
  There is [tutorials](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#tutorial) for example codes to learn how to program the robot.

## **I want to develop a software to communicate with RoboPlus Task code.**
  You can use [Zigbee SDK.](/docs/en/software/embedded_sdk/zigbee_sdk/)

## **Is there any easier way to make the robot's motions?**
  Yes, there is. [Pose Utility](/docs/en/software/rplus1/motion/#pose-utility)

## **Where can I find CAD files?**
  CAD files are not available for PREMIUM.

## **Where can I find Quick Start Guide?**
  Please refer to [Operating manual.](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#operating)

## **Can I purchase specific parts for GP?**
  Not all parts is sold separately.[Link](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#part-list).

## **The controller is not powering on.**
  Please make sure the followings
    - Is the battery charged?
    - Is the battery properly inserted into the controller's battery port?

  If you cannot power the controller with the battery, try powering it with the SMPS. If unsuccessful, request an RMA. If successful, replace the controller's fuse([Instruction link](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#replacing-fuse)) and try powering it with the battery once more. If you still cannot power the controller with the battery, please request an RMA.

## **How can I update or restore the firmware of controller?**
  Please use **RoboPlus Manager(R+ 1.0)** to update / restore controller firmware.

## **How can I update or restore the firmware of Dynamixel?**
  Please use [DYNAMIXEL Wizard](/docs/en/software/rplus1/dynamixel_wizard/#firmware-update)(included in RoboPlus Manager(R+ 1.0)) to update / restore DYNAMIXEL firmware.

## **Controller is making a warning sound / Dynamixel LED is flashing red and torque is disabled.**
  Is the battery charged?
  Make sure that the robot is assembled correctly : DYNAMIXEL horn orientation, cabling and connections.

## **How can I add sensors?**
  - [Attaching ROBOTIS sensors](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#adding-sensors)
  - [Attaching custom sensors](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#make-your-own-sensor)

## **How can I control multiple robots?**
  Please refer to the instruction page. [(Link)](/docs/en/edu/bioloid/premium/#control-multiple-robots)
