# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS PLAY 700 OLLOBOT is a reconfigurable and programmable robotics kit that introduces children to STEAM Concepts.  
Building upon the PLAY 600 PETs, the PLAY 700 emphasizes creative design using ROBOTIS' patented rivet system and adds two elements: programming and smart device connectivity.  
The controller included with the PLAY 700, the CM-50 is a motorized gearbox that brings your child's creation to live. It also includes built-in sensors so that children can learn programming via [SCRATCH]{: .blank} or ROBOTIS [R+TASK]{: .blank}.

## [Windows PC](#windows-pc)
In order to learn how to program a robot using Scratch, please install required softwares.

**WARNING** : [BT-410] requires [BT-410 Dongle] to connect to a PC.
{: .notice--warning}

**NOTE** : [BT-410 Dongle] can be purchased separately. Please visit [ROBOTIS Shop](http://www.robotis.us/bt-410-dongle/#)
{: .notice}

### [Software Install](#software-install)

Scratch adopts block programming GUI that is easier than traditional programming style.  
It is recommended to use Scratch to program the robot.  

- [R+SCRATCH](http://en.robotis.com/service/download.php?no=9%20) Download
- [SCRATCH 2.0 Offline Editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) Download

### [Connect Bluetooth](#connect-bluetooth)  

In order to control sensors and motors from Scratch program, CM-50 controller should be connected to Scratch via R+Scratch.  

![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_bt410topc.png)

Connect [BT-410 Dongle] to the USB port on the PC.  
After finishing assembly of a robot, turn on the controller's power.  
By taking [BT-410] module close to the [BT-410 Dongle], they'll automatically be paired.  
Succesful pairing will turn on the solid blue LED for both [BT-410] and Dongle modules.  

### [Run Scratch](#run-scratch)

1. Run the R+Scratch program. Select `CM-50` on the controller menu.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_a_scratch.png)

2. Click on Port tap and then `Auto Search` to find the port connected to controller automatically.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_b_scratch.png)

3. Click on `Connect` button to connect the controller to Scratch program.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_c_scratch.png)

4. Click on `Open Scratch` to open saved Scratch program. In order to write a new program, click on `New Scratch`.

5. Double click on the program to run. After saving, Scratch will run.  
  ![](/assets/images/edu/play/700/play_700_e_scratch.png)

6. On the Scratch program, click on `More Block` to find out available blocks for CM-50 controller.  
There are blocks for controlling motors and sensors in the CM-50 controller.   
Green dot indicates the robot is connected to the program.

## [Straightness Tuning](#straightness-tuning)

If the robot dosenâ€™t move straight and keep steering to the right or left, the straightness can be tuned under Tuning Mode.  

Please refer to [Straightness Tuning](/docs/en/parts/controller/cm-50/#straightness-tuning) instruction from CM-50 manual.
