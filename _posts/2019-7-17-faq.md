# [FAQ](#faq)

## [Enable SSH Server in Raspberry Pi](#enable-ssh-server-in-raspberry-pi)

First you have to install `SSH` on `Remote PC` and `Raspberry Pi`.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install ssh
```

In case of Raspberry Pi (TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi), since the SSH server of Ubuntu MATE 16.04.x and Raspbian is disabled by default. If you want to enable SSH, please refer to the documents below.

- [SSH Instruction](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/)
- [Ubuntu MATE in Raspberry Pi](https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/)

or you can use following commands.

``` bash
$ sudo service ssh start
$ sudo ufw allow ssh
```

Before start to connect SSH, you need to check `host name`. Redbox in below image shows it.

Then, you can use SSH following command in `Remote PC`.

``` bash
$ ssh ${HOSTNAME}@xxx.xxx.xx.xx
```

## [Timesync between TurtleBot3 and Remote PC](#timesync-between-turtlebot3-and-remote-pc)

**NOTE**: This solution is subject to connect internet on your `TurtleBot` and `Remote PC` under same network.
{: .notice--info}

- Install `ntpdate`, and synchronize to NTP server on both `TurtleBot` and` Remote PC`.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install ntpdate
$ sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
```

## [Setup Dynamixels for TurtleBot3](#setup-dynamixels-for-turtlebot3)

**WARNING**: Please connect only **single** Dynamixel with OpenCR.
{: .notice--warning}

### Download Setup Firmware

As shown in below image, from the example menu, go to `turtlebot3` → `turtlebot3_setup` → `turtlebot3_setup_motor`, download the firmware to OpenCR board, and proceed with setting process. 

After completing the setup, download the proper TurtleBot3 firmware to OpenCR.

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/faq/dynamixel_setup_1.png)

Click the `Upload` button on the Arduino IDE to download and once download is completed, Click the `Serial Monitor` icon on the upper right corner of the application as shown in next image.

Connect the Dynamixel to the OpenCR. Note that this firmware only works with one Dynamixel, so you have to connect only one Dynamixel at a time.

### Change Dynamixel Setting

When the `Serial Monitor` is executed, a menu for the Dynamixel setup is displayed as shown in below image. TurtleBot3 consists of two Dynamixel actuators on the left and right respectively, so select the Dynamixel based on the assembly position. To set up the left motor, enter `1`.

To prevent input mistakes, a confirmation menu is displayed once again. To proceed with the changes, enter `Y`.

![](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/faq/dynamixel_setup_4.png)

If you enter `Y`, the setup tool starts to search the connected Dynamixel using different baudrates, and ID. If a Dynamixel is found, it will be reset for the TurtleBot3 configuration. When the setup is completed, `OK` message is printed.

### Dynamixel Test

Complete the setup procedure and verify if the change has been properly made. If you select one of the test menu for the motor, the connected Dynamixel with correct configuration will iterate the rotation in the clockwise and counterclockwise. To end the test, press the Enter key again. To test the left Dynamixel, enter `3` as shown in below image and enter `4` for the right Dynamixel.

## [Can I charge the battery when the battery is connected to TurtleBot3?](#can-i-charge-the-battery-when-the-battery-is-connected-to-turtlebot3)

Charging and discharging the battery at the same is **NOT** recommended and this may void the warranty of the product. If TurtleBot3 needs to be turned on while charging/replacing battery, please follow below procedure:

1. Connect SMPS 12V 5A to OpenCR
2. Disconnect the depleted battery from OpenCR
3. Connect the depleted battery to battery charger or replace the depleted battery with a fully charged battery
4. Connect the fully charged battery to OpenCR
5. Disconnect SMPS 12V 5A from OpenCR

## [How to download the STL files of TurtleBot3](#how-to-download-the-stl-files-of-turtlebot3)

You can download it in the following way.

We released the TurtleBot3 Friends hardware design file at the link below.

- [Locomotion (TurtleBot3 Friends)](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/friends/#turtlebot3-friends-car)

So, you can download the STL files directly from each Onshape address as shown in the following figures.

1. Sign in. (If you do not have an ID, you have to create one.)
2. Click the "toggle tab manager" (A menu will appear on the left side of the browser.)
3. Click the "Parts folder"
4. Right-click on the icon of the file you want to download.
5. Click the "Export..."
6. Finally, you can download the output file type you want.

## [Intel® Joule™ USB-C port is not recognized on Windows 10](#intel-joule-usb-c-port-is-not-recognized-on-windows-10)

Some users have reported that the USB-C port is not recognized on Windows 10 when they were trying to update BIOS. Please check below link that describes the solution that worked out (Thanks for ***Rknlhrqy*** and ***VRAORESEARCH***).

1. [ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/turtlebot-3-successfully-upload-alternative-ubuntu-desktop-16-04-to-joule/2224)
1. [Intel Communities](https://communities.intel.com/thread/109766)


## [Intel® Joule™ freezes while booting/installation](#intel-joule-freezes-while-booting-installation)

If BIOS firmware is not properly installed, this might happen. Please burn the BIOS firmware 193 release version again.

1. Turn off the Joule.
2. Proceed BIOS firmware #193 [update](https://software.intel.com/en-us/flashing-the-bios-on-joule) using file from the below link.
- [Download BIOS Firmware #193](https://downloadmirror.intel.com/26206/eng/joule-firmware-2017-02-19-193-public.zip)
