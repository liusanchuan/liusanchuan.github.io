| Power Connectors      | In order to use various power sources including SMPS, three types of connectors are attached. |
| DYNAMIXEL Connectors  | JST connector 3-pin, 4-pin are provided for communication in two ways                         |
| TTL/RS485 Test Points | TTL data line, RS485 D +, D-line signals can be easily identified with a separate TP          |

# [Cautions](#cautions)

1. When using the terminal block, the left-side is ground and right-side is source, so be careful of polarity when using an external power supply.
2. Since the back of the board is exposed to several pins, it is recommended to combine the provided supporters so that the conductor does not touch the floor to some extent.

# [How to Assemble](#how-to-assemble)

1. Assemble four(4) plastic supporters at each corner of the `U2D2 Power Hub Board` as shown below.

6. Connect power to `U2D2 Power Hub Board`.

    **DANGER** : Do NOT use both power inputs at the same time. Select ONLY one of the power source to connect.
