> CM-100A

- This controller is used in OLLO and can connect other products such as the geared motor box, servo motor, touch sensor, LED module, IR Sensor, etc.
- Create a task code for control using [RoboPlus Task] and use it to control the movements.
- The CM-100A controller does not support RoboPlus Motion.

- Upper Port  : Located right next to the START button. Connects with the USB Downloader (LN-101), IR Receiver, ZIG-110, etc.
- Port 1 ~ 2 : Each port number is represented in bars like I and II. The geared motor box can be connected to the 2 pin port.
- Port 3 ~ 4 : Each port number is represented in bars like III and IIII. The IR Sensor, Touch Sensor, Servo Motor, and LED Module can be connected to the 5 pin port.

# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)

- CM-100A can be connected to the power using 2 AA-size batteries.
- The range of voltage is 2.0V ~ 3.5, and the recommended voltage is 3.0V.
- The simplified circuit composition of the power port is as follows; connect (+) terminal of the battery to the (+) pins and (-) terminal to the (-) pins.

# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-100/cm-100_004.jpg)

- When you press the start button and the LED inside is turned on, the downloaded program is executed.
- Depending on the amount of time the continue button is pressed in the beginning, [Number of pressed Start button] will increase. Thus, if you use this parameter to program, you can arrange different movements pursuant to the number of times the start button is pressed.
- If you press the start button again when the controller is turned on, it will turn off.

# [Connect to PC](#connect-to-pc)

LN-101 is required to connect CM-100A to PC. For more information, please refer to [LN-101].
