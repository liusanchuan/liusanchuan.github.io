- It is used to set or test the operations of CM-5, AX/MX Dynamixel using [RoboPlus Manager].
- It is automatically executed when RoboPlus Manager and CM-5 are connected.

## [PROGRAM]
- It displays the motion edit mode is in progress.
- It is used when the motions are editted with [RoboPlus Motion].
- It is automatically executed when RoboPlus Motion and CM-5 are connected.

# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)

A rechargeable battery is installed in CM-5. If the rechargeable battery is charged, the device is ON when the power switch is set to ON. If you try to connect to external power without using the charger, the power is connected when SMPS is plugged and the power switch is set to ON.  If the power is connected, the Power LED is turned on, and one of the mode LEDs flickers.

- Turning the Power on : The power is turned on by moving the switch from OFF to ON.  
  ※ If the power is not turned on in spite of moving the switch to ON, the internal batteries may have been discharged.  
  Please refer to Charging to recharge, or connect the power using SMPS.
- Start : Move to PLAY using Mode Button to operate robots.  Press START Button to execute when the LED on PLAY flickers.  
  ※ If START button is pressed, the LED on PLAY is not supposed to be flickering any more; that is the normal status of the execution.

**For CM-5, the firmware must be updated to use Roboplus instead of the Behavior Control Programmer(the old version).**  
**Please refer to [Firmware Update] on how to updated firmware in RoboPlus Manager.**
- It is used to control Dynamixel and the peripherals, and it can connect Dynamixel(AX/MX Dynamixel... etc.).
- Specific motions can be edited and saved through [RoboPlus Motion]. The saved motion (mtn file) can be always executed by [RoboPlus Task], and also the motions of each part can be controlled by writing the task codes for control.
