> IR Sensor Array

# [Introduction](#introduction)

- The IR sensor array is a device with 7 mounted infrared sensors. Each IR sensor is capable of detecting black and white colors. The array is capable of emitting sounds.
- The IR array can perform detection at proper distances. The infrared sensors transmitters/receivers  have optimal operating range of 0-5CM.

# [How to Use](#how-to-use)

## [LED](#led)

![](/assets/images/parts/sensors/ir-array_01.png)

The LEDs will be turned on if the sensor value is smaller than the sensor value for black color detection.

## [Black Color Detecting Calibration](#black-color-detecting-calibration)

![](/assets/images/parts/sensors/ir-array_02.png)

The 3-Pin connector provides power; pressing the right button initializes the array with set threshold values. Press the button one more time the arrays halts auto-calibration and reverts back to set threshold values. Set values = (MAX_VALUE + 2 * MIN_VALUE) / 3; where MAX_VALUE is max value of sensors between the first and second button presses, and MIN_VALUE is the min value of sensors between the first and second button presses.

## [Reset](#reset)

Press the left button once and the IR array will reset via the supplied 3Pin cable. Note that this will not change set black detection values.

## [Communications Protocol](#communication-protocol)

IR array communications and communications-related hardware are shown here.
- Comm protocal, packet component please refer to Dynamixel comm.
- Comm hardware refer to the AX series.

# [Control Table](#control-table)

Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation, which exists inside of Dynamixel. The user can control Dynamixel by changing data of Control Table via Instruction Packet.

## [EEPROM and RAM](#eeprom-and-ram)
Data in RAM area is reset to the initial value whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once the value is set even if the power is turned off.

## [Address](#address)
It represents the location of data. To read from or write data to Control Table, the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction Packet.

## [Access](#access)
Dynamixel has two kinds of data: Read-only data, which is mainly used for sensing, and Read-and-Write data, which is used for driving.

## [Initial Value](#initial-value)
In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings. In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the above Control Tables are the ones when the power is turned on.

## [Highest/Lowest Byte](#highest-lowest-byte)
In the Control table, some data share the same name, but they are attached with (L) or (H) at the end of each name to distinguish the address. This data requires 16bit, but it is divided into 8bit each for the addresses (low) and (high). These two addresses should be written with one Instruction Packet at the same time.

## [Control Table Description](#control-table-description)

### <a name="model-number"></a>Model Number (0)
 This address stores model number of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="firmware-version"></a>Firmware Version (2)
 This address stores firmware version of the DYNAMIXEL.

### <a name="id"></a>ID (3)
{% include en/dxl/control_table_id.md %}

### <a name="baud-rate"></a>Baud Rate (4)
{% include en/dxl/control_table_baudrate.md %}

### <a name="return-delay-time"></a>Return Delay Time (5)
{% include en/dxl/control_table_return_delay_time.md %}

### <a name="ir-threshold"></a>IR Detecting Threshold

Set black values for IR #1 ~ #7
This value is referred when detecting black and white color.
 
|Values|Black detection|LED|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Sensor value <= Threshold|BIT 1|ON|
|Sensor value > set value|BIT 0|OFF|

When the sensor is powered, the value in EEPROM area will be used to initialize RAM area Threshold.

### <a name="ir-data"></a>IR sensor values (1 ~ 7)
If infrared light is emitted with enough intensity it will reflect off walls, objects, the receiver will detect the reflected light. Light reflected from bright walls and objects will be read as a high value. Measured value range is 0-1,023.  
Infrared light measured from walls, objects, textures may be output differently including a difference in measurement.
 
### <a name="buzzer-data"></a>Buzzer Notes
A buzzer is installed in AX-S1, and simple beep sounds can be made.  Total 52 musical notes can be made in Buzzer Notes, and various notes can be made because there are whole tones and halftones in each octave.  The values of Buzzer Notes are assigned as the table below.
 
![](/assets/images/parts/sensors/ax-s1_05.png)
 
 
### <a name="buzzer-ring"></a>Buzzer Ringing Time
AX-S1 has a function to control the buzzer alarming time.  It is possible to control by the unit of 0.1 second, and the minimum length is set to 0.3 seconds; the time can be extended up to maximum 5 seconds.  That is, if 0~3 is entered, the buzzer rings for 0.3 seconds; if the value over 50 is entered, the buzzer rings only for 5 seconds regardless of the value.  Moreover, if the ringing is finished, the buzzer ringing time is automatically initialized to '0'.
There are 2 special buzzer ringing time functions for AX-S1.  Firstly, the buzzer can be ringing without stopping.  If 254 is entered in buzzer ringing time, and the number of desired musical notes is entered, the buzzer rings without stopping.  To stop the ringing, '0' is entered in buzzer ringing time.
Secondly, the buzzer can play special melodies.  If 255 is entered in buzzer ringing time, and then the value 0~26 is entered in buzzer notes, 27 melodies corresponding to each number can be played. If the ringing is finished, the buzzer ringing time is automatically initialized to '0'.

### <a name="auto-threshold"></a>Automatic set black detection mode
Mode for automatic black detection set-up from start to finish paramenters. From '0' to '1' starts; from '1' to '0' finishes.

In the IR array if each IR sensor detected black value is lower than the set black valuethe values will be assigned as shown below; the LED turns on.

|BIT|Name|
|:---:|:---:|
|Bit 0|Black detection for IR sensor #1|
|Bit 1|Black detection for IR sensor #2|
|Bit 2|Black detection for IR sensor #3|
|Bit 3|Black detection for IR sensor #4|
|Bit 4|Black detection for IR sensor #5|
|Bit 5|Black detection for IR sensor #6|
|Bit 6|Black detection for IR sensor #7|

### <a name="registered"></a>Registered Instruction

|Value|Meaning|
|:---:|:---:|
|0|There are no commands transmitted by REG_WRITE|
|1|There are commands transmitted by REG_WRITE.|
 
**NOTE** : If ACTION command is executed, the value is changed into 0.
{: .notice}

### <a name="lock"></a>Lock

|Value|Meaning|
|:---:|:---:|
|0|EEPROM area can be modified.|
|1|EEPROM area cannot be modified.|
 
**CAUTION** : If Lock is set to 1, the power must be turned off and then turned on again to change into 0.
