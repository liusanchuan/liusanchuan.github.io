TurtleBot3 supports development environment that can be programmed and developed with a virtual robot in the simulation. There are two development environments to do this, one is using fake node and 3D visualization tool RViz and the other is using the 3D robot simulator Gazebo.

The fake node method is suitable for testing with the robot model and movement, but it can not use sensors. If you need to test SLAM and Navigation, we recommend using Gazebo, which can use sensors such as IMU, LDS, and camera in the simulation.

## [TurtleBot3 Simulation using Fake Node](#turtlebot3-simulation-using-fake-node)

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHXZSLBJHMg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To use `turtlebot3_fake_node`, you need the `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage. Install the package as shown in the following command.

**TIP**: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. The shortcut key for running the terminal is `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`T`.
{: .notice--success}

**NOTE**: The `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage requires `turtlebot3` metapackage and `turtlebot3_msgs` package as a prerequisite. If you did not install it in the [Install Dependent ROS Packages of PC Setup][pc_setup] section, install it first.
{: .notice--info}

``` bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

To launch the virtual robot, execute the `turtlebot3_fake.launch` file in the `turtlebot3_fake` package as shown below. The `turtlebot3_fake` is a very simple simulation node that can be run without having an actual robot. You can even control the virtual TurtleBot3 in RViz with a teleoperation node.

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`. If you want to permanently set the export settings, please refer to [Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL][export_turtlebot3_model]{: .popup} page.
{: .notice--success}

``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch
```

``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
```

## [TurtleBot3 Simulation using Gazebo](#turtlebot3-simulation-using-gazebo)

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzOoJ6a_mOg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are two ways to simulate using Gazebo. first method is to use with ROS through `turtlebot3_gazebo` package and second method is to use only gazebo and `turtlebot3_gazebo_plugin` plugin without using ROS.

If you want to use the first method, see the [instructions below](#ros-packages-for-gazebo). For the second method, see the [following instructions](#standalone-gazebo-plugin).

### [ROS packages for Gazebo](#ros-packages-for-gazebo)

**NOTE**: If you are running Gazebo for the first time on your `Remote PC`, it takes a bit longer than usual.

#### [Simulate in Various World](#simulate-in-various-world)

##### 1) Empty World

The following command can be used to test the virtual TurtleBot3 on the `empty world` of the gazebo default environment.

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`. If you want to permanently set the export settings, please refer to [Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL][export_turtlebot3_model]{: .popup} page.
{: .notice--success}

``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}

##### 3) TurtleBot3 House

`TurtleBot3 House` is a map made with house drawings. It is suitable for testing related to more complex task performance.

``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_house.launch
```

**NOTE** : If `TurtleBot3 House` is excuted for the first time, downloading the map file takes a couple of minutes or more depending on download speed.

#### [Virtual SLAM with TurtleBot3](#virtual-slam-with-turtlebot3)

For virtual SLAM in Gazebo, instead of running the actual robot, you can select the various environments and robot models mentioned above, and the SLAM-related commands will use the ROS packages used in the [SLAM][slam] section.

##### Virtual SLAM Execution Procedure

The following commands are examples of using the TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi model and the turtlebot3_world environment.

- Launch Gazebo
``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
```

- Launch SLAM
``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping
```

- Remotely Control TurtleBot3
``` bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
```

- Save the Map
``` bash
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f ~/map
```

When you run the dependent packages and move the robot in virtual space and create a map as shown below, you can create a map as shown in figure below.

#### [Virtual Navigation with TurtleBot3](#virtual-navigation-with-turtlebot3)

For virtual Navigation in Gazebo, instead of running the actual robot, you can select the various environments and robot models mentioned above, and the Navigation-related commands will use the ROS packages used in the [Navigation][navigation] section.

##### Virtual Navigation Execution Procedure

Terminate all applications that were executed during the virtual SLAM practice and execute
related packages in the following instruction, the robot will appear on the previously generated map. After setting the initial position of the robot on the map, set the destination to run the navigation as shown in figure below. The initial position only needs to be set once.

- Execute Gazebo
``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
```

- Execute Navigation
``` bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=$HOME/map.yaml
```
