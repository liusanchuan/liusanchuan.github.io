This chapter shows some demos using TurtleBot3. In order to implement these demos, you have to install the [turtlebot3_applications][turtlebot3_applications] and [turtlebot3_applications_msgs][turtlebot3_applications_msgs] packages.

**[Remote PC]** Go to `catkin workspace` directory (/home/(user_name)/catkin_ws/src) and clone the turtlebot3_applications and turtlebot3_applications_msgs repository. Then run the `catkin_make` to build the new packages.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ar-track-alvar
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-ar-track-alvar-msgs
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_applications.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_applications_msgs.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

## [TurtleBot Follower Demo](#turtlebot-follower-demo)

{% capture notice_02 %}
**NOTE**:
- The follower demo was implemented only using a 360 Laser Distance Sensor LDS-01. a classification algorithm is used based on previous fitting with samples of person and obstacles positions to take actions. It follows someone in front of the robot within a 50 centimeter range and 140 degrees.
- Running the follower demo in an area with obstacles may not work well. Therefore, it is recommended to run the demo in an open area without obstacles.

<div class="notice--info">{{ notice_02 | markdownify }}</div>

**[TurtleBot]** In order to run this demo, parameter in LIDAR launch file has to be modified. In the below example, Pluma is used to edit the launch file. In the param tag with `frame_id` as a name, replace `base_scan` to `odom` and save the file as shown in the below images.

``` bash
$ pluma ~/catkin_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_bringup/launch/turtlebot3_lidar.launch
```

## [Automatic Parking](#automatic-parking)

{% capture notice_04 %}
**NOTE**:
- The `turtlebot3_automatic_parking` demo was using a 360 laser Distance Sensor LDS-01 and a reflective tape. The LaserScan topic has intensity and distance data from LDS. The TurtleBot3 uses this to locate the reflective tape.
- The `turtlebot3_automatic_parking` demo requires `NumPy` package.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--info">{{ notice_04 | markdownify }}</div>

**[Remote PC]** Install `NumPy` package with below commands. If you already installed numpy, you can **skip** below commands.

``` bash
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip
$ sudo pip install -U numpy
$ sudo pip install --upgrade pip
```

**[Remote PC]** Run roscore.

```bash
$ roscore
```

**[TurtleBot]** Bring up basic packages to start TurtleBot3 applications.

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
```

**[Remote PC]** If you use TurtleBot3 Burger, set the model of TurtleBot3 like command below.

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`. If you want to permanently set the export settings, please refer to [Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL][export_turtlebot3_model]{: .popup} page.
{: .notice--success}

```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
```

**[Remote PC]** Run RViz.

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch
$ rosrun rviz rviz -d `rospack find turtlebot3_automatic_parking`/rviz/turtlebot3_automatic_parking.rviz
```

**[Remote PC]** Launch the automatic parking file.

``` bash

## [Automatic Parking Vision](#automatic-parking-vision)

{% capture notice_05 %}
**NOTE**:
- The `turtlebot3_automatic_parking_vision` uses raspberry pi camera and so the robot which is a default platform used for this demo is TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi. Since it parks from finding out AR marker on some wall, printed AR marker should be prepared. Whole process uses the image get from the camera, so if the process is not well being done, configure the parameters, such as brightness, contrast, etc.
- The `turtlebot3_automatic_parking_vision` uses rectified image based on `image_proc` nodes. To get rectified image, the robot should get optic calibration data for raspberry pi camera. (Every downloaded turtlebot3 packages already have the camera calibration data as raspberry pi camera v2 default.)
- The `turtlebot3_automatic_parking_vision` package requires `ar_track_alvar` package.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--info">{{ notice_05 | markdownify }}</div>


**[Remote PC]** Run roscore.

```bash
$ roscore
```

**[TurtleBot]** Bring up basic packages to start TurtleBot3 applications.

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch
```

**[TurtleBot]** Start the raspberry pi camera nodes.

```bash
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_rpicamera.launch
```

**[Remote PC]** Raspberry pi package will publish compressed type image for fast communication. However, what will be needed in image rectification in `image_proc` node is raw type image. Hence, compressed image should be transform to raw image.

```bash
$ rosrun image_transport republish compressed in:=raspicam_node/image raw out:=raspicam_node/image
```

**[Remote PC]** Then, the image rectification should be carried out.

```bash
$ ROS_NAMESPACE=raspicam_node rosrun image_proc image_proc image_raw:=image _approximate_s=true _queue_size:=20
```

**[Remote PC]** Now should start the AR marker detection. Before running related launch file, the model of what will be used by this example code should be exported. After running the launch file, RViz will be automatically run under preset environments.

```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_automatic_parking_vision turtlebot3_automatic_parking_vision.launch
```

## [Load Multiple TurtleBot3s](#load-multiple-turtlebot3s)

**NOTE**: This application must be set firmware version `1.2.1` or higher.
{: .notice--info}

**[Remote PC]** Run roscore.

```bash
$ roscore
```

Bringup multiple turtlebot3s with different namespace. We recommend the namespace includes common words such as `tb3_0`, `tb3_1` or `my_robot_0`, `my_robot_1`

**[TurtleBot(tb3_0)]** Bring up basic packages with `ROS NAMESPACE` for nodes, `multi_robot_name` for tf prefix and `set_lidar_frame_id` for lidar frame id. This parameters must be the same.

```bash
$ ROS_NAMESPACE=tb3_0 roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch multi_robot_name:="tb3_0" set_lidar_frame_id:="tb3_0/base_scan"
```

**[TurtleBot(tb3_1)]** Bring up basic packages with `ROS NAMESPACE` for nodes, `multi_robot_name` for tf prefix and `set_lidar_frame_id` for lidar frame id. This parameters must be the same but different other robots.

```bash
$ ROS_NAMESPACE=tb3_1 roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch multi_robot_name:="tb3_1" set_lidar_frame_id:="tb3_1/base_scan"
```

Then the terminal you launched `tb3_0` will represents below messages. You can watch TF messages have prefix `tb3_0`

```
