## [SBC Setup](#sbc-setup)

**WARNING**: Setup work requires Power and Time. So battery is not suitable. We recommend using SMPS (AC adapter) during this work.
{: .notice--warning}

**NOTE**: We are offering three models of TurtleBot3. TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi use Raspberry Pi 3 B and B+, and TurtleBot3 Waffle uses Intel Joule 570x. Choose from the following pages according to the SBC used in your model.

### [Raspberry Pi 3](#raspberry-pi-3)

{% capture info_01 %}
**NOTE**: There are two ways to install Linux and ROS to Raspberry Pi 3. 
- First method: If you prefer Ubuntu MATE, please take the first method `Install Linux (Ubuntu MATE)` below. This method should install the ROS and dependency packages after installing the Linux images. This instruction takes about 1 hours to install ROS and related packages for TurtleBot3.
- Second method: We provide the Linux distro image based on Raspbian. They are pre-installed with ROS and ROS-packages related TurtleBot3. It is available immediately without additional installation. If you want to use it, please take the second method `Install Linux based on Raspbian` below.

{% capture info_02 %}
**NOTE**: Raspberry Pi 3 B+ is available in TurtleBot3 Burger and Waffle Pi. If you use Raspberry Pi 3 B+, please refer to the following.
- For Ubuntu MATE, it does not support the Raspberry Pi B+. So the first method described above can not be used. Instead, we recommend using a second method `Install Linux based on Raspbian` below.
