|![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_008.jpg)|Demo program is loaded and DARWIN-OP is ready to operate|

## [Demo Program](#demo-program)

DARWIN-OP comes with preconfigured 4 modes of operations:
- Demonstration-ready mode
- Autonomous Soccer mode
- Interactive Motion mode
- Vision Processing mode

DARWIN-OP defaults to Demonstration-ready mode when turned on.  
To switch between modes, press the `MODE` button. DARWIN-OP announces each mode with each pressing. Each mode has its own indicating LED.  
To run each mode, press `START` button. After pressing `START` DARWIN-OP will stand up and begin operations.

**RESET Button**  
The `RESET` button resets the actuators, not the entire robot. Please keep in mind that the demo program is still running in the main controller.

**CAUTION** : The RESET button powers off all actuators. It is highly recommended that DARWIN-OP is set at kneeling position before pressing RESET or hold DARWIN-OP by its carrying handle. Pressing the RESET button while DARWIN-OP is moving may result in damages the the actuator(s) or/and robot itself.
{: .notice--warning}

### [Demonstration Ready Mode](#demonstration-ready-mode)

This is the default mode when you turn DARWIN-OP on. LED 1 (red), LED 2 (blue) and LED 3 (green) are on; the head LED changes from green to amber and DARWIN-OP announces "demonstration-ready mode." DARWIN-OP is ready for action.

**NOTE** : DARWIN-OP remains in kneeling position and does not move under this mode. This is the best-suited mode to change power source.
{: .notice}

If you wish to completely end the demo program without turning DARWIn-OP off please refer here.

3. Select a color(s) card and place it in front of DARWIN-OP. The card should be approximately 15cm (about 6in) in front of DARWIN-OP.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_023.jpg)![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_024.jpg)![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_025.jpg)

#### Stop Vision Processing Mode

Press the "MODE" button DARWIN-OP returns to **Demonstration-Ready Mode**.

If you experience difficulties with DARWIN-OP reading the card you may need to adjust color and white balance. For more information refer to [Camera Calibration](#camera-calibration)

## [Camera Calibration](#camera-calibration)<a name="camera-calibration"></a>

If it the lighting around DARWIN-OP is too bright or dark, it maybw difficult to operate DARWIN-OP.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_026.jpg)![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_027.jpg)

You may change settings for color and white balance.  
You may modify color settings to change ball color for Soccer Mode.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_028.jpg)

To be able to manipulate color settings you must:
1. Connect to DARWIN-OP via ether wired or wireless LAN.
2. Check on the 'Obtain an IP address automatically' menu from Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) properties of 'Local area connection properties'
3. Have a web browser Firefox (recommenced) or Internet Explorer.

The following procedure to access color settings assumes a connection via wired LAN:
1. Ensure you have a proper connection with DARWIN-OP.
2. Open up your computer's web browser.  

  **NOTE** : Please abstain from using Chrome web browser as it can cause memory leaks!
  {: .notice}

3. On the address line type: http://192.168.123.1:8080
4. Click on the increment/decrement buttons until you have desired settings. You can see the changes visually.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_029.jpg)

The following values are the default values.

||Ball|Red|Yellow|Blue|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Hue(0 ~ 360)|356|0|60|225|
|Tolerance(0 ~ 180)|15|15|15|15|
|Minimum Saturation(0 ~ 100)|50|55|45|45|
|Minimum Value(0 ~ 100)|10|0|0|0|
|Gain(0 ~ 255)|255|255|255|255|
|Exposure(0 ~ 10,000)|1,000|1,000|1,000|1,000|

### [HSV Color Space](#hsv-color-space)

The HSV(Hue, Saturation, Value) model, also known as HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), define color space in terms of three constituent components:

**Hue Scale**

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_030.jpg)

- Hue
  - The color type (such as red, blue, or yellow)
  - Ranges from 0-360 (but normalized to 0-100% in some applications)
- Saturation (chroma)
  - The "vibrancy" of the color
  - Ranges from 0-100%
  - This is sometimes called the "purity" by analogy to the colorimetric quantities excitation purity and colorimetric purity
  - The lower the saturation of a color the more faded its appearance; thus useful to define desaturation as the qualitative inverse of saturation
- Value (intensity)
  - The brightness of the color
  - Ranges from 0-100%

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_031.jpg)

How do you know if color calibration for the ball has been properly adjusted for the desired color?

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_032.jpg)

The illustration above depicts the ball covered in a patch of orange and green at the bottom right.
- Orange means that color calibration has been properly matched to the color of the ball desired. In this particular case the color of the ball is blue.

However, there is also a patch of green at the lower right portion of the ball.
- Green means that the hue tolerance range between the ball settings and one of the other colors settings (blue in this case) overlap.

Recall that the default hue for blue is 225 with a tolerance of 15. This gives blue a hue range from 210 to 240.
In this example the hue value for the ball has been changed to 216 (for a blue ball) with tolerance at 15. This gives the ball hue range from 201 to 231.

Values between 210 and 231 overlap. This means that the hue value(s) at the lower right portion of the ball is between 210 and 231.

## [Shutdown](#shutdown)

To shut down the computer inside DARWIN-OP perform one of the following:
1) Press the depression button (1st depression), located on the front left side of the chest, 3 times.
2) If you can connect a monitor and see the screen, click on "darwin" (located at the top right corner of the screen) and then click on "Shut Down."

DARWIN-OP will announce 'bye-bye” and begin shut-down procedure:

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_034.jpg)

DARWIN-OP’s head LED will blink on and off (OS shutdown). Once the head LED stops blinking and remains off you may cut the power off. The eye LED's remain on. Ignore the eye LED's; turn power off.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_035.jpg)

**NOTE** : If you cut the power off while the head LED blink, then DARWIN-OP may have problems turning on the next time.
