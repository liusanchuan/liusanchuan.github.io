## [Fuse Replacement](#fuse-replacement)

There may be a time when you turn the rocker switch on DARWIN-OP may not power up at all regardless of power source (DC, battery). If that's the case then this is most likely caused by a blown or defective fuse.

The fuse is rated at 12V (volts) and 10A (amps).   
Replacing the fuse requires requires disassembly of DARWIN-OP's main body and expose the sub-controller CM-730.   
Once the sub-controller is exposed locate the fuse. The diagram below shows the fuse location enclosed by the red rectangle.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_231.jpg)

Carefully remove the fuse with a pair of tweezers. Afterwards carefully insert a new fuse.

**WARNING** : Improper care during removal or insertion of the fuse may result in damage(s) to the fuse housing or/and other components of the sub-controller Cm-730.

### Maintenance

Robotis recommends that DARWIN-OP users perform preventive maintenance once every 1200 minutes (20 hours) worth of motion.  
Robots are moving mechanical parts and preventive maintenance is necessary to keep robots in optimum conditions.  
Perform maintenance in a well-lit and dry place.  
Neglect may result in unnecessary and costly damage.

### Procedure

Every single screw and nut should be tightened.  
Overtightening is not necessary and may be counterproductive as it may damage the threading of the bolts and wrenches.

### Disassembling DARWIN-OP

Remove the battery.  
Remove the plastic skin on DARWIN-OP. This includes the head and body.  
If your DARWIN-OP includes FSR units on its feet then you should also remove the plastic casing from the feet.

### Divide DARWIN-OP into the following groups/sections

- Upper body and neck (ID 1, 2, and 19) frames (2 elbow/shoulder, neck, sub controller, 4 short inter-actuator)  
  Disconnect any connection between sub controller and main controller.  
  Disconnect any cables between the arms and upper body.  
  Remove arms from upper body.
- Head (IS 20) frames (head frame, USB camera)
- Each arm (ID 3,5 right, ID 4,6 left) frames (hand, elbow/shoulder, and actuator lateral)
- Torso (ID 7, 8, 9, 10) frames (main controller, groin, 2 dxl-main controller bumper, power sitch pcb, power sitch, l lower back, 2 hip, 4 long inter-actuator)  
  Disconnect cables from legs to torso. Remove legs from torso.  
  Main controller does not need to be detached from forso.
- Each thigh (ID 11 right thigh, ID 12 left thigh) frames (2 actuator lateral, thigh)
- Knee and lower leg (ID 13, 15 right, ID 14, 16 left) frames (leg, actuator lateral
- Foot (ID 17 right, ID 18 left) frame (2 long inter actuator, foot, ankle

### Wiring

Ensure that all connections are properly secured.  
Ensure that the long cables are laid flat free of twists.  
Replace cables whenever the protective coat has a cut leaving the wire(s) exposed to air.

### Cleaning

Please ensure that the actuators, main controller and sub controller are free of dust. Although dust may not harm the internal components of both main controller and sub controller under dry condition, humidity may cause static potentially doing costly permanent damage to the controllers.  
The recommended tools to remove dust, dirt and debris compressed air blower, or a non-metallic soft brush

## [Dynamixel Replacement](#dynamixel-replacement)

There may be an instance where you will need to replace a Dynamixel actuator due to failure. The following page will guide you on how to replace a Dynamixel actuator.  
To replace an MX-28 on DARWIN-OP you need to complete the following procedures.
1. Proper installation of horn, bearing set to the new MX-28.
2. Proper ID and baud rate setting.

Please refer to the [Assembly Guide](http://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinop/files/Hardware/Mechanics/Physical%20Information/) for reference during replacement procedure.

### Proper Installation of Horn and Bearing Set

Every MX-28 on DARWIN-OP comes comes installed with the horn (front side of actuator). Some of the MX-28's come with the bearing set (rear side of actuator) installed as well. You will need a wrench for 2.5mm thick bolt (provided).

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/horn_bearing.jpg)

#### Installing the Horn

Place the thrust horn washer into the actuator before inserting the horn.
You must carefully align the horn to the wheel gear serration by aligning dots.

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/horn_alignment.jpg)

Once alignment is properly done, gently push the center of the horn toward the actuator.
Make sure that the horn washer is in place as you tighten the bolt.


#### Installing the Bearing Set

You may need to remove the bearing set from the previous actuator and reinstall it into the new actuator.
The bearing set can also be purchased separately.
As bearing set is rotating freely, therefore alignment is not required when assembling to DYNAMIXEL.

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/bearing.jpg)

For more information on the bearing set please click [here](http://robotis-shop-en.com/shop/step1.php?number=824). Note that the bearing set is for the RX-28, which will fit perfectly on the MX-28 as they both share the exact physical dimensions.

### Proper ID and baud rate setting#

#### Method A
You have USB2Dynamixel and a Robotis dedicated robot controller (CM-5, CM-510, or CM-700)

1. Provide power to new MX-28. That is connect one TTL port from the MX-28 to the controller; then power on the controller.
2. Connect the other TTL port of the MX-28 to the USB2Dynamixel dongle (Make sure to set the switch to "TTL" on the dongle).
3. Connect the dongle to an open USB port in your PC. Run Dynamixel Wizard.
4. Change the ID number from 1 to the proper number.
5. Change the baud rate from 34 (576000 bps) to 1 (1 Mbps).

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_232.jpg)

6. After replacement is done. Run [DXL Monitor] and reset all Dynamixels.

[DXL Monitor]: /docs/en/platform/op/development/#dynamixel-monitor

Click [Dynamixel Wizard] for more information.

[Dynamixel Wizard]: /docs/en/software/rplus1/dynamixe_wizard/

#### Method B
You have USB2Dynamixel but do not have a Robotis dedicated robot controller (CM-5, CM-510, or CM-700).

Steps 2 through 5 from Method A remains unchanged. Step 1 needs to be modified for proper power supply.  
You will need 2 separate 3-pin TTL cables (they come supplied with every DARWIN-OP). The following procedure is recommended:

1. Open the Interface panel of DARWIN-OP (back cover). Carefully remove the plastic back panel to prevent any damages to the interface board cables.

2. Disconnect both Interface Board cables.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_233.jpg)

3. Temporarily disconnect ALL currently connected cables. You can choose any TTL port. Do not disconnect the power cable from sub-controller to main controller. Doing so will not allow Dynamixel Wizard proper Dynamixel search.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_234.jpg)

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_235.jpg)

4. Connect a spare TTL cable to any open port and the other end to the new MX-28.

5. Connect a second TTL cable to the other port of the MX-28. Connect the other end of the cable to the USB2Dynamixel controller. Afterwards connect USB2Dynamixel to the PC.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_236.jpg)

6. Turn the switch on on DARWIN-OP and let Ubuntu load (this process may take up to 2 minutes).  
  **NOTE** : The head LED will remain green and will not turn amber. The demo program will not run automatically.

7. Connect to DARWIN-OP and run Dynamixel Monitor.  
  Once Dynamixel Monitor is running all actuators will show as "fail" even with the new MX-28 connected. Do not exit Dynamixel Monitor. Leave the program running.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_237.jpg)

8. On Windows run Dynamixel Wizard.  
  Change address 4 (baud rate) from the default value of 34 to 1. You must perform this operation with Dynamixel Wizard as Dynamixel Monitor does not support this function currently. If you do not change the baud rate then Dynamixel Monitor will fail to scan the actuator.
  Change address 3 (ID) from the default value of 1 to the desired value. You may also use Dynamixel Monitor to change ID as well.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_238.jpg)

  **NOTE** : RoboPlus Manager does not currently support the CM-730 controller because it lacks the Serial Connector input.

Once the baud rate value is set to 1 you may return to Dynamixel Monitor and type scan to verify success on baud rate change (the first attempt may show the new actuator as "fail" if so type scan again until "OK" shows on screen).

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_239.jpg)

Once all changes are made you still need to exit Dynamixel Monitor and [Shut down DARWIN-OP] properly.
Once shut down and powered off replace the Dynamixel actuator and restore all connections.
Once connections are restored return to [DXL Monitor] and reset all Dynamixels.

[Shut down DARWIN-OP]: /docs/en/platform/op/getting_started/#shutdown

If you are replacing 2 or more Dynamixel then you must perform this procedure again as Dynamixel Wizard will show errors when multiple Dynamixels with the same ID and same baud rate are connected.  
Once the actuator has been replaced it is highly recommended that you update the firmware with Firmware Installer so that ALL Dynamixels are matched with the same firmware.

#### Method C
You do not have USB2Dynamixel controller nor a Robotis dedicated robot controller (CM-5, CM-510, or CM-700).

Ensure you perform proper horn installation and proper bearing set installation (if applicable).  

##### Example 1
Replace the the right elbow (ID 5) with a new actuator without disconnecting the remaining actuators.  
If so let's assume we need to replace the right elbow (ID 5) and already replaced the actuator before performing the software changes:

1. Run [DXL Monitor] You will see the following appear on screen

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_240.jpg)

  > Despite installing the new actuator replacement for ID 5 the software still displays as "fail." Now its time to make the proper changes.

2. Go to ID 1 by typing id 1 and temporarily assign a different ID number. You may assign numbers between 21 and 199 but refrain from numbers between 1 and 20.
let's say change to 39 so type **wr 3 39**.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_241.jpg)

  > Notice that the command prompt changed from ID:1 R_SHOULDER_PITCH to ID:39 UNKNOWN.

3. Return to the CM-730 command prompt by typing id 200.
4. Type scan and notice the "extra" ID on ID 39. You'll also notice that ID 1 and 5 failed.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_242.jpg)

5. Type the command **wr 4 34** while remaining in ID 200. This means that the communications baud rate between the CM-730 and MX-28 switched from 1Mbps to 576000 bps.
6. Type scan and the following will appear onscreen

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_243.jpg)

  > Notice that all actuators fail except ID 1 (remember that the default values on a new Dynamixel is ID 1 and baud rate 34). Notice that ID 39 does not appear anymore. No need to worry this is because ID 39 does not currently have a specific function in DARWIN-OP and the baud rate of said ID is 1 Mbps; whereas the current baud rate between the CM-730 and and MX-28 is 57600 bps.

7. go to ID 1 by typing **id 1**
8. The command prompt will change from ID 200 to ID 1

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_244.jpg)

9. change the baud rate from 34 to 1 by typing **wr 4 1**

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_245.jpg)

10. Once baud rate of the new actuator matches with the rest of the actuators return to to ID 200 by typing **id 200**

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_246.jpg)

11. Change the baud rate between CM-730 and MX-28 back to 1 Mbps by typing **wr 4 1**
12. Return to ID 1 by typing **id 1**; change the ID from 1 to desired ID. In this case to ID 5 by typing **wr 3 5**
13. Return to ID 200 and type **scan**. Notice that ID 5 has been set, but ID 1 still failed and there's ID 39. Go to ID 39 by typing **id 39**

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_247.jpg)

  > Remember that ID 39 is a temporary ID change for ID 1. Now its time to revert the change back.

14. Go to ID 39 by typing **id 39**. Restore ID 1 again by typing **wr 3 1**. Return to ID 200 and run **scan**.

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_248.jpg)

15. Run **reset all** and all DARWIN-OP will be back to normal again.

Repeat the same procedure again if replacing more than 1 actuator.

##### Example 2
Replace the the right elbow (ID 5) with a new actuator with less software manipulation.

Just like Method B disconnect all Dynamixels from the CM-730 but do not disconnect the power from CM-730 to Main Controller.   
However in this case instead of the need for 2 3-pin TTL cables you'll only need 1.

1. Connect the new actuator to any TTL port.
2. Turn DARWIN-OP on and run [DXL Monitor]. Do not worry about setting DARWIN-OP in the kneeling position during this procedure as the demo program will fail to run automatically due to the disconnected Dynamixels. Please set DARWIN-OP in a stable position (either sitting or laying down on its belly).
3. Run **scan** and you will notice that all ID's will fail

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_249.jpg)

4. Change the baud rate on ID 200 from 1 Mbps to 57,600 bps by typing **wr 4 34**
5. Run **scan** again and you'll notice the OK on ID 1 (remember that all new Dynamixels have default values 1 for ID and 34 for baud rate).

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_250.jpg)

6. Go to ID 1. Change the baud rate of ID 1 from 57,600 bps to 1 Mbps by typing **wr 4 1**

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_251.jpg)

7. Return to ID 200 and change the baud rate back to 1 Mbps

  ![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_252.jpg)

8. Return to ID 1 and make the ID change. In this case change to ID 5 by typing **wr 3 5**
9. Return to ID 200.
10. The ID change is done. [Shut down DARWIN-OP] properly, power off. Perform replacement, restore all connections and turn DARWIN-OP on again. Remember to set DARWIN-OP in the kneeling position as all actuators are connected and the demo program will run automatically.
11. Perform the [killall] procedure to end the demo program. Run [DXL Monitor] and reset all Dynamixels.

[killall]: /docs/en/platform/op/development/#terminate-demo-program

For multiple Dynamixels, you may only repeat steps 3 through 9. You can disconnect the actuator after step 9, connect the new Dynamixel and run from step 3 again.

Once done replacing Dynamixel(s) and settings set appropriately run [Firmware Installer]. Select option 2 and you are done. This is an important final step because it sets the angle limits on the joints.  
DARWIN-OP is back to normal again.

`Example 1` requires less hardware work but more programming work, as well as keeping careful track of changes made during programming and repeating the entire process for multiple Dynamixels.  
`Example 2` requires more hardware work (unscrewing/screwing disconnecting/connecting), but less on software work.

Pick the method that most convenient for you.

**NOTE** : The reset all procedure at the end is necessary because DXL Monitor will set the angle limits on all Dynamixels. Setting angle limits is a robot safety mechanism to prevent joints from overextending, therefore preventing damage to the robot.
{: .notice}

Pressing the reset button on DARWIN-OP will reset settings of the sub-controller CM-730 to default values. For example:
- If the CM-730 has the baud rate changed from 1 Mpbs to 576000 bps, pressing the reset button will change the baud rate back to 1Mpbs (default).
- If the eye LED has been changed from blue to orange, pressing the reset button will change the color back to blue (default).

## <a name="controller-connection"></a>[Controller Connection](#controller-connection)

Sometimes you may find DARWIN-OP irresponsive despite the main controller (fitPC) and sub-controller (CM-730) operating normally. In such case it may be a rare connection loss between the main controller and sun-controller.  
The main controller and sun-controller are connected by a physically modified USB connection. Although USB is quite reliable, just like any other USB device you may lose connection.  

You can verify the connection by the following:
- Hardware component
  - Verify proper physical connection between main controller and sub-controller
- Software component
  - Running any program from the source code should output a message about CM-730 not detected.
  - go the the '/dev' directory, type ls and look for ttyUSB0. If its not there then there's a connection loss. In such case simply restart DARWIN-OP.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_253.jpg)

If problem persists contact ROBOTIS for an RMA Procedure.

## [Camera Connection](#camera-connection)

There may be an instance when DARWIN-OP's main controller may lose connection with the camera. Please ensure that the USB camera cable is properly connected to the the camera and main controller.

To verify camera connection with Linux OS perform the following.
1. On a terminal window go to the '**/dev**' directory.
2. Type **ls** and you'll see a list of devices and look for '**video0**' This is the camera as an USB device.

![](/assets/images/platform/op/op_254.jpg)

If you do not see a '**video0**' device then you may need to replace the camera cable and/or camera. in such case you may replace the USB cable, the camera, or contact ROBOTIS for an arrangement.

**NOTE** : If you lose physical(mechanical) connection between the main controller and sub-controller, then you automatically lose camera connection. This is because the USB cable for the CM-730 and camera share the same molex connection.
{: .notice}

## [Self Maintenance Checklist](#self-maintenance-checklist)

You may run your own maintenance check should DARWIN-OP have some anomalies.

### Power does not turn on

#### Check and proceed
1. Does DARWIN-OP eyes turn blue when turning power on?
  - yes
    > Check for fan noise
  - no, but Cm-730 powers on
    > Check the LED cable from CM-730 to eye. If the cable is defective then post your problem here.

2. Can you hear fan noise from the back of DARWIN-OP?
  - yes
    > Check for LED's
  - no, but CM-730 powers on
    > Check the cable from CM-730 to Interface board (back). if the cable is defective contact us for an arrangement.
  - no, and CM-730 is not getting power
    > If that's the problem then post the problem here.

  **NOTE** : If the CM-730 does not get any power then the FitPC will not get any power.
  {: .notice}

3. Does the head LED turn on?
  - yes
    > Check for "Ubuntu does not start" symptom.
  - no, but CM-730 and FitPC turn on fine
    > If the cable is defective then post your problem here.
  - no, but CM-730 turns on fine
    > Check the physical connection between CM-730 and FitPC; followed by connecting a HDMI?DVI display, mouse, and keyboard and operate DARWIN-OP's PC. Check for "Ubuntu does not start" symptom.

#### Ubuntu does not start

1. Connect a HDMI/DVI display, mouse, and keyboard and operate PC.
  - Operate PC from DARWIN-OP

2. Does the FitPC's main screen with the Intel Atom logo appear?
  - yes, the PC is still good.
    > You may use Linux's advanced settings to restore the OS
    > or, use the provided USB thumbdrive and [restore OS](#clonezilla-recovery).
  - no
    > post your problem here.

#### Demo program does not work when turning DARWIN-OP on

1. Properly shut down DARWIN-OP and restart again. If this happens again more then twice then check the following
  - There are a few ways to [Shut down DARWIN-OP].

2. Do you have the most updated firmware version of the CM-730 and MX-28 installed?  
  Run Dynamixel Monitor..... are all Dynamixel OK?
  - no
    > Install the latest firmware
  - yes
    > There's a chance that the baud rate of any of the MX-28's is/are not properly set to 1 Mbps.  
      Use Dynamixel Monitor to check if address 4 (baud rate) is set at value 1. If any MX-28 is not set at 1 Mbps then set it to 1 Mbps.
  - yes, the MX-28 had the latest version of firmware, baud rate was 1 Mbps and ID was properly set. But, after some time Dynamixel Monitor shows as fail.
    > In this case post your issue here.

3. Check Connections
  Make sure that the main controller and the sub-controller are physically [connected](#controller-connection)
  Make sure to check
  - the camera
  - camera cable
  - cable connection to camera
  - cable connection to main crontroller
  - make sure they are physically connected
  - run this procedure.

#### Specific joint(s) doesn't/don't work

1. Are cables around the joint worn out?
  - yes
    > Replace cable(s). Keep in mind due to the nature of the daisy chain (serial) network of Dynamixel some MX-28 may appear as malfunctioning (not working at all).  
      The MX-28 connected directly to the CM-730 are "most significant" If any "most significant" MX-28 or connecting TTL cable to said MX-28 go defective then all connected "lesser significant" MX-28(s) will appear malfunctioning as well.  
      The following is the connection order from "most significant" to "least significant"  
        ID1 -> ID3 -> ID5  
        ID2 -> ID4 -> ID6  
        ID19 -> ID20  
        ID7 -> ID9 -> ID11 -> ID13 -> ID15 -> ID17  
        ID8 -> ID10 -> ID12 -> ID14 -> ID16 -> ID18  
      For example. if ID 13 does bad then ID15 and ID17 will appear to go bad. However, ID11, ID9, and ID7 remain unaffected.
  - no
    > Use [DXL Monitor] to check status of the MX-28(s). As a precautionary measure it is strongly advised th check the "lesser significant" MX-28 first and work your way up to the defective MX-28. If you ran all checks and the MX-28 still malfunctions then post your problem here.

#### Unusual motions/DARWIN-OP "behaves" strangely.

1. Check the robot limbs. Are there any defective frames?
  - Look for any bad frames around the defective area. There's a chance that bolt(s) and nut(s) may have come loose. Tighten them and check the status of the MX-28 and check for proper position sensor (horn) alignment. For any defective frames post your problem here.

#### Slow or choppy motions

1. Battery conditions (if DARWIN-OP is running only under battery)
  - DARWIN-OP has been programmed to beep if battery power is low. However, in noisy environments you may not be able to hear such beeps. Keep an eye for any slow, strange, or choppy motions.

2. Linux OS conditions
  The OS from the fitPC has been optimized so that DARWIN-OP can perform smoothly.  
  There's a chance that there are too many programs running in the background.  
  Likely causes:  
  - turning on automatic updates while DARWIN-OP is operating
  - actively running remote desktop during operations
  - setting a very-high display resolution (i.e. 1080p)
  - any program/process that takes too many fitPC resources
  - any combination from a to d.
  Please bear in mind that this is a limitation of Intel Atom's system design and not from Linux OS, nor the fitPC, nor ROBOTIS.

3. Interfacing conditions
  - We strongly recommend interfacing with DARWIN-OP via SSH terminal rather than remote desktop. However, if remote desktop is a must then close any background programs from Ubuntu and use conventional screen resolutions (i.e. 1024x768).

#### DARWIN-OP cannot "see/find" the ball

1 Check [Color and White Balance Settings]
  - Color and white balance settings are always an issue with image processing; this includes DARWIN-OP. You must always check lighting conditions in your working environment. With this issue in mind we have provided a color and white balance calibration testing program.

[Color and White Balance Settings]: en/platform/op/getting_started/#camera-calibration

#### Head and eye LED do not turn on nor the LED's from the back of DARWIN-OP

1. Please refer to the [Layout] of the LED's. Please see "Power does not turn on" symptom.

[Layout]: /docs/en/platform/op/getting_started/#layout

#### Can't get any sound from DARWIN-OP

- Check in the following order; if any of these solutions solves the audio issue you may not need to run the remaining tests.  
  1. There may be an instance when audio may have been disabled.If that's the case you can re-enable audio by a simple Ubuntu restart or you may need to enable audio again via control center. If this does not solve the issue move on to the next resolution.
  2. if audio capabilities have "disappeared" from Ubuntu then you may need to re-enable it by installing Ubuntu's audio drivers. If this does not solve the issue move on to the next resolution.
  3. If Ubuntu's audio capabilities are fine then you need to check the volume level on Ubuntu. make sure that the volume level is at least 75%. If audio capabilities on Ubuntu and volume levels are fine then move on to the next resolution.
  4. Check the audio speaker (located in chest) and CM-730, check the audio cable between FitPC and CM-730. In this case you may need to replace the speaker. If a replacement is necessary please post your issue here.
