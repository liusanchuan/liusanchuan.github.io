## [What is OP3?](#what-is-op3)
Open Platform Humanoid Project

![](/assets/images/platform/op3/op3_product_rev2.png)

ROBOTIS OP3 is the latest miniature humanoid robot platform from ROBOTIS that succeeds ROBOTIS OP(aka “DARWIN OP”) and ROBOTIS OP2(aka “DARWIN 2” or “DARWIN OP2”). One of the noticeable changes of ROBOTIS OP3 is made in actuator by replacing MX-28 actuators with XM-430 actuators. Another significant change is also made in internal PC by replacing Atom based SBC(Single Board Computer) with Intel i3 based NUC. With the XM-430 which supports Dynamixel Protocol 2.0, OP3 has improved torque along with current based control and loaded with various functions. Intel NUC allows highly improved computing power that supports 64-bit OS and Bluetooth 4.1. In addition, OP3 is developed under ROS(Robot Operating System) to utilize various packages in ROS ecosystem. All these hardware improvements and ROS support allows developers to focus more on research and development compare to the preceding robots.

- Physical Differences from ROBOTIS OP2  
  - ROBOTIS OP3 does not come with a design skin, however, 3D modeling files are provided in order to support 3D print for the default design skin.

OP3 looks quite different from OP2 as default skin is not provided. Users can download design skin files.  
Downloaded skin files can be used for 3D printing.  
ROBOTIS OP3 is loaded Intel NUC with i3 processor to achieve significant improvement in computing power.  
OP3 supports HDMI and Display Port(DP) while OP2 only supports mini HDMI.  
There are 1 RGB LED and 3 LEDs, 4 buttons on the back of OP3. From left to right, each button stands for Mode, Start, User, Reset.

- Here are some mechanical differences :
  - New mini HDMI port connector on the ROBOTIS OP2
  - Location of the ports
  - ROBOTIS OP3 no longer has the 3.5mm microphone and audio jacks

  > Moderate changes have been made in the back panel of OP3.

- Advantages of developing with ROBOTIS OP3 compared to ROBOTIS OP2  
  As mentioned above, there are several changes in OP3 and advantages of the new OP3 are listed as follows:
  - New Actuators(higher torque)
  - Increase of SSD capacity
  - Increase of RAM capacity
  - Dramatic improvement in computational power
  - Replacing Mini HDMI with HDMI
  - User friendly sub-controller(CM-730 → OpenCR)
  - Improved camera
