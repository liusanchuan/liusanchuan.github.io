## [What is OP2?](#what-is-op2)
Open Platform Humanoid Project

![](/assets/images/platform/op2/op2_product.jpg)

ROBOTIS OP2 (as known as “DARWIN 2” or DARWIN-OP2”) has been upgraded with greater computational performance compare to ROBOTIS OP (as known as “DARwIn-OP”).  
Despite the change in name the robot may be colloquially still be called “Darwin”. The only major change comes from the upgrade in computational power.  
When ROBOTIS OP was first released it was stated that it supported Windows OS.  
This claim is, and remains, technically true. However, in practice installing Windows is impossible due to the 4GB cap of the embedded SSD from ROBOTIS OP’s PC.  
The scant 4GB made difficult installing the later releases of Ubuntu and significant workaround was required to be able to install the later Linux releases.  
ROBOTIS OP2 upgrade is aimed at eliminating the difficulties relating to computing from the previous generation.  
You can now focus your efforts more into developing the robot and less on devoting resources for computing.

- Visual differences with ROBOTIS OP:  
  - Other than the color difference, the overall appearance remains unchanged.

- Here are some mechanical differences :
  - New mini HDMI port connector on the ROBOTIS OP2
  - Location of the ports
  - ROBOTIS OP2 no longer has the 3.5mm microphone and audio jacks

  > Here are some mechnamical differences

- Advantages of ROBOTIS OP2 compared to ROBOTIS OP
  - User-replaceable SSD
  - User-replaceable RAM
  - Significantly increased computation power
  - Reduced size of the PC
  - Reduced size of the management controller (CM-730 ⇨ CM-740)

## [Control Table](#contrl-table)
Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of CM-740. The user can control CM-740 by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

### EEPROM and RAM
Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

### Address
Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

### Access
CM-740 has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

### Initial Value
In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

### Highest/Lowest Byte
In the Control table, some data share the same name, but they are attached with (L) or (H) at the end of each name to distinguish the address. This data requires 16-bit, but it is divided into 8bit each for the addresses (low) and (high). These two addresses should be written with one Instruction Packet simutaneously.

## [EEPROM Area](#eeprom-area)

## [Address Function Help](#address-function-help)

### Model Number
Represents the Model Number.

### Firmware Version
Represents the firmware version.

### ID
Is a unique number to identify Dynamixel.  
Values range from 0 (0x00) to 253 (0xFD), Value 254 (0xFE) is used as the Broadcast ID.  
If the Broadcast ID is used to transmit Instruction Packet, then it can command to all Dynamixels.  

**NOTE** : Please be careful not to duplicate the ID of connected Dynamixels.
{: .notice}

### Baud Rate
Represents the communication speed. 0 (0x00) to 254 (0xFE) can be used for it. This speed is calculated by using the below formula.  
Speed(BPS) = 2000000/(Data+1)

| Data |  Set BPS  | Target BPS | Tolerance |
|:----:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|
|  1   | 1000000.0 | 1000000.0  |  0.000 %  |
|  3   | 500000.0  |  500000.0  |  0.000 %  |
|  4   | 400000.0  |  400000.0  |  0.000 %  |
|  7   | 250000.0  |  250000.0  |  0.000 %  |
|  9   | 200000.0  |  200000.0  |  0.000 %  |
|  16  | 117647.1  |  115200.0  | -2.124 %  |
|  34  |  57142.9  |  57600.0   |  0.794 %  |
| 103  |  19230.8  |  19200.0   | -0.160 %  |
| 207  |  9615.4   |   9600.0   | -0.160 %  |

**NOTE** : Maximum Baud Rate error of 3% is within the tolerance of UART communication.

### Return Delay Time
Is the delay time per data value that takes from the transmission of Instruction packet until the return of Status packet.  
0 (0x00) to 254 (0xFE) can be used. The delay time per data value is 2 microseconds (usec).  
If the data value is delayed by 10, 20 usec the initial value is 250 (0xFA) (i.e., 0.5 msec).

### Status Return Level
Decides how to return Status packet. There are three possibilities:

| Value |               Return of Status Packet                |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------:|
|   0   | No return against all commands (Except PING Command) |
|   1   |           Return only for the READ command           |
|   2   |               Return for all commands                |

**NOTE** : When Instruction packet is Broadcast ID, Status packet is not returned regardless of Status return level.

### Dynamixel Power

| Value |                          Meaning                          |
|:-----:|:---------------------------------------------------------:|
|   0   | Turn off the power of all Dynamixels connected to CM-740. |
|   1   | Turn on the power of all Dynamixels connected to CM-740.  |

### LED Pannel

|  BIT  | 7 ~ 3 |  2   |  1   |  0   |
|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| Value |   X   | LED4 | LED3 | LED2 |

If each bit is SET, applicable LED lights up.  
If each bit is RESET, applicable LED goes off.  
EX) When the LED Panel = 3 (00000101), the LED4 and LED2 light up.

### LED5 / LED6

|  BIT  | 15 |         14 ~ 10         |          9 ~ 5           |         4 ~ 0          |
|:-----:|:--:|:-----------------------:|:------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Value | X  | the value of blue light | the value of green light | the value of red light |

LED HEAD/ LED EYE is 3 color LED. It can represent the value of 32 steps by colors.  
It can be represent by controling the value of light by colors.

### BUTTON STATUS

|  BIT  | 7 ~ 2 |                1                |               0                |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| Value |   X   | the state value of START button | the state value of MODE button |

It is the value which represents the state of buttons.  
If the bit is SET, it represents that the button is pressed.  
If the bit is RESET, it represents that the button isn't pressed.

### PRESENT VOLTAGE
Present (input) voltage.  
This value is 10 times larger than the actual voltage. For example, when 10V is supplied, the data value is 100 (0x64)

### MIC 1 , MIC 2
