# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS DREAM II LEVEL 3 consists of robot examples that can be controlled using an infrared receiver and remote control.  
In addition, you can learn various operations and programs using the servo motor.  
ROBOTIS DREAM II LEVEL 3 combines a total of 11 chapters of workbook and example robots to provide programming learning, application of sensors, understanding of servo motors and sensors, and problem solving.  
You can learn the principles of robot assembly by building robot examples through 11 chapters.  
In chapter 12, it guides you for self-learning through “Create your own robot.” ROBOTIS DREAM II LEVEL 3 requires users to learn and download program.  

To download, you should use the USB cable included in ROBOTIS DREAM II LEVEL 1.  
If you want to build and program your robots using more parts and peripheral devices, please purchase the ROBOTIS DREAM II Level 4 or necessary parts separately.

**CAUTION** : ROBOTIS DREAM II Level 2 requires parts from ROBOTIS DREAM II Level 1.  
Please make sure to purchase Level 1 first to build the robots in Level 2.  
The controller ([CM-150]) in ROBOTIS DREAM II level 2 contains a "Comprehensive Program" that can make the robot move without downloading a program.  
To program or download a program you will need the USB Cable included in the ROBOTIS DREAM II Level 1.  
If you want to build and program your robots using more parts and peripheral devices, please purchase the ROBOTIS DREAM II Level 3 or necessary parts separately.
