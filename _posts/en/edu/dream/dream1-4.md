# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS DREAM Level 4 comes with a remote controller to control the robot in many ways. Now that you have an idea of how the flow chart works and have a basic knowledge of programming, this level allows you to prepare for competitions. Play games using the programs provided for download on our website and keep a record to see how well you do. Experience how the sensors can affect your results.
