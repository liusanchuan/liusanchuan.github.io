  - You can build up 14 example robots with Bioloid Beginner Kit and learn the principle of robot building.
  - From a simple barrier bar of 1 DOF to an automobile or walking droid of 4 DOF, it is possible to build the robot and edit the example programs. It will help increasing your understanding for robot programming.
  - Purchasing 4 more AX-12+ for Bioloid Beginner Kit, you can build intermediate-level robots of 8 DOF.
  - Also, purchasing 14 additional AX-12+ for Bioloid Beginner Kit and frame set for Comprehensive Kit, you can build intermediate-level robots and advanced-level robots of 18 DOF.
