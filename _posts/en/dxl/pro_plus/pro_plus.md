- **Strong and durable reduction cycloid gearing** : DYNAMIXEL PRO+ implements removable reduction cycloid gears. Small and lightweight cycloids allow a high-ratio reduction gear device. Also cycloid gears are more resistant to vibrations and impacts resulting in minimal backlash.

- **Variety of models** : DYNAMIXEL PRO+ motor, reduction ratio, communications type, etc have been accommodated to meet various price ranges. The user is able to choose the most proper DYNAMIXEL PRO+ model necessary for the robot.

- **Variety of control algorithms** : DYNAMIXEL PRO+ adopts position, velocity, and electrical current control algorithms. The user can control these 3 aspects in any combination and properly tune the robot. DYNAMIXEL PRO+ provides a graph illustrating the relationship between electrical current and torque. This feature is useful for torque control via current control.

- **Precision control** : With a maximum of 1,003,846 resolution, users can control about 0.0004 degrees per unit allowing for high-precision control.
