# How the X-series can communicate with dynamixel with protocol 1.0?

Users can select Dynamixel [Protocol 1.0] and [Protocol 2.0] when using X-series.
Even if Protocol 1.0 is selected, Protocol 2.0 Control Table will be used.
It is recommended to use an identical protocol version for multiple Dynamixels.

**TIP** : MX-series DYNAMIXEL except MX-12W can be upgraded to Control Table 2.0 for the new firmware features, new control table, and "Protocol Version" parameter for Communication Protocol flexibility.

# What is RoboPlus?

RoboPlus is a software to create a customized programming for every ROBOTIS product.

  - [RoboPlus 1.0](http://en.robotis.com/model/board.php?bo_table=print_en&wr_id=48)

  - [RoboPlus 2.0](http://en.robotis.com/model/board.php?bo_table=print_en&wr_id=47)

# What is the difference between RoboPlus Task and RoboPlus Motion?

 To use motions in a task code, the motion file must be downloaded.

  - [RoboPlus Task](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/getting_started/#introduction)

  - [RoboPlus Motion](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/motion/#introduction)

# I want to know the meaning of the error code occurs during "RoboPlus Task" program execution.

 [Please refer to the page](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/task_misc/#error-messages)

# What shall I do if the rule check error shows up while I am writing RoboPlus Task code?

 [Please refer to the page](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/task_misc/#rule-check)

# My robots' joints get loose while I make the motions.

 Dynamixels have an [Auto Shutdown function](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/rplus1/motion/#dynamixel-auto-shutdown-function). This function prevents Dynamixels from being damaged.

# How can I develop a firmware for the controller by myself using C Language?

 For advanced users, Embedded C is offered to develop its own programming.

# I want to develop a software to communicate with RoboPlus Task code.

  You can use [Zigbee SDK.](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/embedded_sdk/zigbee_sdk/)

# I want to control Dynamixel with PC development environment such as Visual Studio.

  [Dynamixel SDK] is a standard programming library to develop S/W controls Dynamixel.

# I want to communicate with multiple Zigbees simultaneously.
