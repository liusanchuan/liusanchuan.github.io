  > Users can add in more motors (the motor will be added just on the screen, not specifically onto the robot).
  > Planned to support 3D created models from R+ Design to be imported into R+ Motion.

4. Can the MTN file be converted to an MTNX file?
  > Yes, the motion data can be converted, but the 3D model is not supported (will be supported later).
 
5. Can the MTNX file be converted to an MTN file?
  > No, and there is no plan to support it.
 
6. The Motion file won’t play properly after editing it.
