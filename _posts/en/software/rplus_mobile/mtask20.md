## Can I use Bluetooth module in R+ Task 2.0?

- Each controller could support different Bluetooth module, so please check the compatibility.
  - [BT-110], [BT-210], [BT-410]

## The controller does not connect well.

- Restart the controller by turning it off and then on, and try again. If the problem continues, please update the controller’s firmware to the latest version.
