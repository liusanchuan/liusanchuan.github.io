# [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## [Connect Controller](#connect-controller)

1. Connect controller to the PC. (Please refer to each [controller information] for connecting the controller to the PC.)
2. Select the communication port to use. Use the "Automatic Search" function to easily select the appropriate port.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_002.png)

    If the chosen communication port is being used by another program, you must first find and stop the program.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_003.png)

    If RoboPlus Manager is unable to find a controller, the following error message will be shown.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_004.png)

    - Check if the controller is connected to the PC. (See controller information for information on how to connect the controller.)
    - Check if the controller is turned on.  
    - Check if the correct communication port was chosen.

3. Start management. (Please refer to the [managing information of each controller].)


# [Firmware Management](#firmware-management)

## <a name="firmware-update"></a>[Firmware Update](#firmware-update)

Firmware is the program installed in the controller, and is used to execute .tsk programs or to manage the controller.  
RoboPlus Manager automatically connects to the internet and searches for firmware updates.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_005.png)

### Updating Controller Firmware

1. When the controller is connected, the controller's firmware version will be retrieved. If a newer firmware is available, it will ask whether to download the latest firmware.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_006.png)

2. When the 'OK' button is pressed, it will begin updating the firmware.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_007.png)

3. You can check your controller's model number and firmware version.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_008.png)

4. Press the "Next" button to begin updating your firmware. Be careful not to turn the power off or disconnect the cable while the firmware is being updated.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_009.png)

5. Once the firmware has been updated, Press the "Finish" button to return to the controller maintenance page.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_010.png)

## [Firmware Recovery](#firmware-recovery)

When there is a problem with the controllerâ€™s firmware, RoboPlus Manager can be used to recover the firmware.  
For CM-150 and CM-200, you will need the latest RoboPlus Manager (ver. 1.0.31.0 or higher) to execute the recovery.

### Recover Controller Firmware

1. Connect the controller to the PC using LN-101.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/interface/ln101_connect.jpg)

2. Run RoboPlus Manager and open the controller firmware management wizard. On the menu bar, click the firmware management button to run the firmware wizard.  
    (CM-150 and CM-200 require some pre-steps prior to proceeding. Please refer to the message below.)

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_011.gif)

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_012.gif)

3. Select the port number for connecting the controller.  
    Because the firmware is broken, the controller cannot be automatically found. So, you must manually select the port number the controller is connected to.  
    The controller cannot be found if the port is being used, so please close other programs before proceeding. Select the port number then click search.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_013.gif)

4. Turn OFF then turn ON the controller (this process can be skipped for CM-150 and CM-200).  
    Turn OFF and turn ON the controller to proceed with the recovery

5. Check the controller information.  
    When the controller is found, the information for the firmware to be downloaded will be displayed.  
    Please check whether the model name is the same as the name of the connected controller (the version on the controller information is the version of the boot loader, not the firmware)

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_014.gif)

6. Firmware Recovery

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus1/manager/roboplus_manager_015.gif)

### [Sensed Current](#sensed-current)

This parameter is used to check the current being consumed.

#### Characteristics

##### EX-Series
- If the value is 512, the current is 0 ampere.  That is, there is no current flowing.
- If the value is larger than 512, the current is rotating the motor clockwise, and the size of the current is proportional to the size of the data. (1 = aprroximately 10 mA)
- For example, if the data is 612, 1A (612-512=100 => 100x10mA = 1,000mA) is being used to rotate the motor in the clockwise direction.
- If the value is smaller than 512, the current is rotating the counterclockwise, and the size of the current is proportional to the size of the data. (1 = aprroximately 10 mA)
- For example, if the data is 312, 2A (512-312= -200 => 200x10mA = 2,000mA) is being used to rotate the motor in the counterclockwise direction.

##### MX-Series

- If the value is 2,048, the currnet is 0 ampere.  That is, there is no current flowing.
- If current flows in normal direction then output values are larger than 2,048.
- If current flows in the opposite direction then output values are smaller than 2,048
- Current flow values are proportional to data values (value unit of 1 = 4.5mA units)
- For example if data reads 2,148 then 2,148 - 2,048 = 100 -> 100 x 4.5mA = 450mA. The output current is 450mA in the normal direction.

The`AX-S1` is equipped with a function to count sounds louder than a certain threshold.  For example, it is possible to count claps.  This parameter is used to read or initialize the number of detected sounds.  

#### Characteristics

- "Sound Count" uses numbers between 0 and 255.
- When sounds are no longer detected, the number of detected sounds will be input into the "Sound Count" parameter.  
- Because "Sound Count" is not initialized automatically, the user must reset it to 0 before use.
