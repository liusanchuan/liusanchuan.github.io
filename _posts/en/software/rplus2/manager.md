# [Introduction](#introduction)

## [RoboPlus Manager 2.0](#roboplus-manager-20)
The RoboPlus Manager 2.0 manages the Controller and Dynamixel devices that comprise the robot.
By connecting the product, the user can update the product to the latest version and test the Control Table.
The functions that were previously provided in RoboPlus Manager 1.0 and Wizard 1.0 have been combined in RoboPlus Manager 2.0.

## [Definition of Firmware](#definition-of-firmware)

Firmware is basic software that is installed on a device to operate the hardware. Firmware contains communication protocols with PC, smartphone, and other devices so it is recommended to keep the firmware to the latest version.  
All devices (Controller, Dynamixel etc) have firmware installed when first purchased, but new versions can be released if there are additional functions / bug fixes.
 
### Role of Controller Firmware
- Operates the control program written using RoboPlus Task
- Interprets the motion data written using RoboPlus Motion
- Performs packet communication function with PC, smartphone, and Dynamixel
 
### Role of Dynamixel Firmware
- Performs packet communication function with Controller when operating control program or motion on the Controller
- Performs packet communication function with PC, smartphone, and Dynamixel

### Importance of Firmware Update

- A new firmware can be released if there are additional functions or modifications to previous functions.
- A new firmware can be released to improve compatibility if supporting a new S/W is necessary.
- A new firmware can be released if there is a bug fix.
- If the product does not function properly or communication is unstable, updating to the latest firmware may fix the problem.

## [Preparation for XM/XH Series](#preparation-for-xmxh-series)

There are two preparations that need to be done for using the XM Series in R+Task2.0 or R+Motion2.0.  
(Preparing the H/W / Configuring the Dynamixel Channel)
 
### Preparing the H/W

1. Apart from the OpenCM9.04 and XM Series, the “OpenCM 485 EXP board” is needed as in the figure below.
2. Connect the three components below with cables.

### Configuring Dynamixel Channel

1. Open R+ Manager 2.0 and select the Dynamixel2.0 product, then click on the Update & Test menu.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/manager/roboplus_manager2_30.jpg)
 
2. Connect the OpenCM9.04 to the PC by usingLN-101 or BT-210(or BT-110), then turn on the OpenCM 485EXP.
3. Follow the instructions below to search the product forOpenCM9.04 (Initially the Dynamixel Channel value of the OpenCM9.04 is set to Default so the XM/XH Series does not appear in the search result).

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/manager/roboplus_manager2_31.jpg)
 
4. After the process of updating the product, the Control Table will open.
5. From the Control Table list, set the Dynamixel Channel value to EXP Board (Expansion Board)and click Save.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/manager/roboplus_manager2_32.jpg)
 
6. When the configuration is finished, close the Control Table window and restart the OpenCM 485 EXP.  
    (As it is restarted the, the mini TTL bus of the OpenCM9.04 is deactivated, and then Dynamixel bus of the OpenCM 485 EXP is activated.)
7. Open the Update & Test menu again and check that the XM/XH Series is properly detected in the search result.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/manager/roboplus_manager2_33.jpg)
 
8. When the configuration is finished, you can now use the XM/XH Series in R+ Task 2.0 and R+ Motion 2.0.  
    (Supported from versions R+ Task 2.0 v2.1.0, R+ Motion 2.0 v2.4.0 or later)
