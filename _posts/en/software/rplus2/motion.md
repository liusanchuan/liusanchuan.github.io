# [Introduction](#introduction)

Motion is a necessary set of position and speed data for motors, which eventually becomes a valid movement for a robot.  
In order to make the robot move, the correct Motion project file must be edited and downloaded to the robot.  
The Motion project file has an .mtnx extension, and is shown on the PC as the icon below.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_001.gif)

- What is the relationship between a Motion file and Task file?  
  The Task file is a program code which defines the logics on how the robot will think and move. The Motion file is the data which defines the movements based on the decisions made from the Task file.  
  If the robot only performs simple movements, its Task file will not require any Motion file. But if precise movement is required, such as a dance choreography, it will be much more efficient to use the Motion file.  
  (If the Motion file is used in the Task code, the Motion file must be downloaded to the robot as well)

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_005.gif)

## [3D Robot and Actual Robot](#3d-robot-and-actual-robot)

The 3D robot acts as an avatar of the actual robot. Even when an actual robot is not present, the 3D robot can be used to edit or playback motions.
When the actual robot is connected, and Sync Mode is turned on, the 3D robot can be used as an interface to control the actual robot.

When creating a new motion project, users can select a 3D model to open, based on the product lineup provided in the software.
The 3D robot initially selected can be edited after creating the motion project.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_006.gif)

If the user is using a user created robot apart from the provided 3D models, a customized robot can be created by adding descriptions on each motor (image below).

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_007.gif)

## [Motion Data](#motion-data)

The data structure of a motion file is described in the image below.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_008.gif)

1. Key-Frame  
    This is a similar concept as the Motion Step in the previous Motion software.  
    It is a combination of 1) pose and 2) time on timeline, to express WHAT (pose) to show WHEN (time). For example, if a ‘Hurrah’ pose is saved as a Key-Frame on 1.5 sec on the timeline, the robot will start to move into the ‘Hurrah’ pose as the timeline approaches 1.5 sec.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_009.gif)

2. Motion Unit  
    This is a similar concept as the Motion Page in the previous Motion software. It is a group of Key-Frames placed on the timeline, to show a continuous movement. As seen on the image below the ‘Clap’ motion unit has the “hands spread” Key-Frame on 0.5 sec, and “hands closed” Key-Frame on 1 sec. The continuous movement (Motion Unit) will be a clapping motion.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_010.gif)

3. Motion  
    This is a similar concept as the Page Link in the previous Motion software. Motion is a group of Motion Units to express long movements, such a dancing motions.  
    As seen in the image below, the “Taekwon Dance” Motion is a link (group) of the Motion Units “Left Jab”, “Left turn”, “Right Attack 1”, and “Right Uppercut”.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_011.gif)

4. Motion Group  
    File size is unlimited in Motion 2.0. So, when downloading to the robot, users must select the specific Motions they want to download to the robot, while checking the space available on the robot.  
    The list comprised of the selected Motions is called the “Motion Group”. The bar on the right displays the amount of space the Motion Group will take up on the robot’s controller.  
    On the image below, the “Demonstration Set” Motion Group has 4 Motions in the list, and takes up 13.4% of the controller’s space.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_012.gif)

5. 3D Robot  
    The 3D robot is the output when motion data is put in. It is also active even when an actual robot is not connected,so users can easily check and playback the motion they are creating.  
    Users are required to select a 3D robot when creating a motion file, and may also use the “Change 3D Robot” menu.  
    The image below is an example showing the same motion data opened on different 3D robots.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_013.gif)

## [Editing Timeline](#editing-timeline)

In the previous version of Motion software, the Motion Page was used to express a robot’s motion. In Motion 2.0, the “Motion Unit” is used.
The Motion Unit has one timeline, and poses are placed (saved) on the timeline.

In the previous version, users were only able to save 7 Steps in one Page, and were required to create another Page when making 8 or more Steps.
But in Motion 2.0, there is no restriction on the number of Steps (poses). Also, by using the Key-Frame function on the timeline, the Steps are now placed on a flow of time
for easier expression and editing of continuous motion.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_014.gif)

> Editing the Key-Frame – Key-Poses are placed on the timeline to create a continuous motion

A Step placed on the timeline is shown by the bar, for an intuitive display of the interpolation pose between each Step.

## [Editing Flow Control](#editing-flow-control)

In the previous version, the link between motion pages, repetition, and playback speed were all dependent on each Page. Due to this it was difficult to reuse data that was created.  
But in Motion 2.0, the flow control (link, repeat, playback speed) is no more dependent on the Motion Unit. So, the Motion Units are now reusable with variations on repetition or speed. Also, by using 2D blocks, arrows, and flow chart, users can easily check on how the final motion will be.

The image below is an example of a motion flow. The final motion will be performed as;

1. Play the Motion Unit “Greet 2” twice at 1.3x speed
2. Play the Motion Unit “Sit” once at 1.0 speed
3. Play the Motion Unit “Stand Up” once at 1.0 speed.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_015.gif)

## [Download Motion File](#download-motion-file)

In the previous version, the motion file size was limited based on the space available on the robot’s controller. So, saving a large file required multiple files to be saved.  
In Motion 2.0, the motion project itself has no limitations on the file size. Once a large project is completed, users can just select the Motions they want to download to the robot.  
These Motions can be grouped into Motion Groups for easier grouping, and finally, one Motion Group can be downloaded onto the robot.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_016.gif)

The bar on the right shows the space taken up (and available) on the robot when selecting the Motions to download.  
Each Motion in the Motion Group is named with a Index Number, which can be used in R+ Task to call the specific Motion.

`Caution when Downloading` If the actual robot was used to playback a motion while editing motions, the saved motion on the robot’s controller is deleted. So, once motion editing is completed, please download the new motion onto the robot’s controller.

3. Select the type of joint (motor) to use and set its ID. Click “Apply” to add the joint to the joint list.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_054.gif)

4. Once the joint list is completed and the new project is created, the custom robot will be shown on the screen.  
    Since it is difficult to analogize and display the actual custom robot on the 3D model, it will be helpful if the users frequently playback the motion on the actual robot (Sync Mode) to check on their status.

## [Change 3D Robot](#change-3d-robot)

The Motion file is created and edited based on the initial 3D robot that was selected. Users can change the 3D robot while in the midst of a project, while maintaining the motion file data.  
The guide below is an example of changing the 3D robot from “Humanoid A-type” to “Humanoid C-type”.

1. Move to the Home tab, and click on the “3D Robot” button on the left.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_055.gif)

2. Click on the “Change 3D Robot” button on the bottom, and select the robot to be change into.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_056.gif)

3. Once the 3D robot is changed, the window will automatically change.
4. If there are unnecessary joints, such as the two motors depicted below, it is recommended to delete them. Move to the Home tab again and click on the “3D Robot” button. (If there are no joints to delete, please skip step 5)

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_057.gif)

6. The unnecessary joints are now deleted.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_059.gif)

## [Pose Mirroring](#pose-mirroring)

The 3D Robot’s joints have a horizontally symmetrical matching joint on the opposite side, based on the vertical center line drawn below.  
The Mirroring function uses this symmetry for mirroring or exchanging the pose on the opposite side.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_060.gif)

### Pose Symmetry

1. For Pose Symmetry, users must first select the joints that will be the basis for the opposite side.
2. Click on the “Mirroring” button.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_061.gif)

3. The selected joints’ values will now be entered (mirrored) onto the horizontally symmetrical joint on the opposite side.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_062.gif)
 
### Pose Exchange

1. For Pose Exchange, users must select the joints that will be the basis for exchanging, and also select the corresponding joints that will receive the values from the basis joints.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_063.gif)

2. Click on the “Mirroring” button.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_064.gif)

3. The selected joints will now have their values exchanged with each other.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_065.gif)

## [Edit Motion Index Number](#edit-motion-index-number)

The Motion Index Number is used when a motion data has to be called in RoboPlus Task.  
The Index Number of the Motion data downloaded on the controller must match the Index Number used for calling in Task.

1. Move to the “Motion Download” tab, select a Motion Group for editing its Index Number, and click on the “Edit Motion Group” button.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_066.gif)

2. Select the Motion Number you would like to edit the Index (or Exit Index) number for, change the number, and click the “Enter” key.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_067.gif)

3. If a duplicate number is already present, a message will be shown as below, and the user must select how to proceed.  
    If the Exit Index is not inputted, a random number will be assigned.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_068.gif)

## [Copy Motion Data](#copy-motion-data)

1. Open the Motion file with the data to copy.
2. Move to the “Home” tab, click the “3D Robot” button, and click on the “Change 3D Robot” button.

3. Check the 3D Robot of the Motion file, and close the “Change 3D Robot” window.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_070.gif)

4. Run another Motion 2.0 program file, and create a new project with the 3D robot you checked in step 3.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_071.gif)

5. Open the list of Motion Units, and select the Motion to copy with Ctrl+C.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_072.gif)

6. In the other Motion 2.0 window, with the new project, open the Motion Unit list and push Ctrl+V to paste the copied Motion Unit.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus2/motion/roboplus_motion_073.gif)

{% capture rplus2_motion_warning_01 %}
**CAUTION** : When copying data between Motion files
- Data that can be copied : joint value, Key-Frame, Motion Unit, and Motion.
- If a data with the same name already exists in the new (blank) project, the data will not copy.
- Copying must be proceeded in the order of Motion Unit -> Motion. If a Motion is copied without copying any Motion Units, an empty Motion will be pasted.

8. The difference between the initial pose and the offset pose will be applied as the offset.  
    (Offset pose – Initial pose = Offset)

## [Convert mtn File](#convert-mtn-file)

RoboPlus Motion 2.0 (R+ Motion 2.0) can also open the old RoboPlus Motion 1.0 file (*.mtn) as well. But, users will have to convert the file in *.mtnx first.

## [FAQ](#faq)

1. Which products are supported?
  > PREMIUM, STEM, SMART, DARWIN-MINI
  > CM-200, CM-510, CM-530, CM-700, OpenCM9.04C, AX series, MX series, robots made with XL-320
  > All products supporting TTL / RS485 communication

2. Which 3D models are supported?
  > All example robots of the products supported (listed above)

3. How many joints are supported?
  > If using DYNAMIXELs, 26 joints can be used, from ID 0~25.
  > If using CM-200, 8 joints can be used, from ID 3~10.

4. Can other 3D models be added?
  > Currently, customs robots can only be displayed by an array of motors shown on the screen. In the future, users will be able to import robots created from R+ Design (PC version only).

5. Can the MTN file be converted into MTNX file?
  > Please refer to the e-Manual page “Converting the old file (*.mtn)”

6. Can the MTNX be converted into MTN?
  > Not supported, and currently there is no plan to support it in the future.

7. The motion is not performing correctly after the editing the Motion file. How can I solve this?
  > You must download the Motion Group to the robot after editing the Motion file.

8. The controller is not connecting properly. How I can I solve this?
  > Please try turning the controller ON/OFF.
  > (If you’re using CM-200, turn the controller off, hold the power button for 2~3 sec to stop the task, and try again.

9. What is the “Multiplier” in a Joint Group?
  > Multiplier is used when adjusting multiple joints simultaneously, but the users want to adjust each joint value with different weight.
  > Increasing/decreasing the Multiplier value will change the weight of the adjustment.

  > Calculation : current angle = previous angle + (rotating direction x multiplier x number of clicks)
